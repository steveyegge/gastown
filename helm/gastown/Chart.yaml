appVersion: "0.57.11"

dependencies:
  - name: bd-daemon

    # During development, use local path. For production, publish bd-daemon to

    repository: "file://../../beads-charts/bd-daemon"
    # Adjust the path above to match your local checkout layout. The default
    # assumes: gastown/helm/gastown/ and beads-charts/bd-daemon/ share a

    # For local dev with beads repo directly, you can symlink:
    #   ln -s ~/beads/helm/bd-daemon ~/gastown/beads-charts/bd-daemon
