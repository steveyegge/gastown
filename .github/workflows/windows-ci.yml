# Windows CI - DISABLED
#
# Windows tests are disabled because Gas Town is a Unix-first system.
# The tests require infrastructure that doesn't exist on Windows CI:
# - bd binary not installed
# - Symlinks require elevated permissions
# - Shell script test stubs don't work
# - File locking semantics differ
#
# See bugs: bd-b2z, bd-wxx, bd-up4, bd-1na, bd-vab, bd-brj, bd-pxx
#
# To re-enable, uncomment the 'on:' triggers below.
