Three creation paths feed into the same lifecycle. Completion is event-driven
via the daemon's `ConvoyManager`, which runs two goroutines:

- **Event poll** (every 5s): Polls all rig beads stores + hq via
  `GetAllEventsSince`, detects close events, and calls
  `convoy.CheckConvoysForIssue` — which both checks completion *and* feeds
  the next ready issue to a polecat.
- **Stranded scan** (every 30s): Runs `gt convoy stranded --json` to catch
  convoys missed by the event-driven path (e.g. after crash/restart). Feeds
  ready work or auto-closes empty convoys.

Manual overrides (`close --force`, `land`) bypass the check entirely.

> **History**: Witness and Refinery observers were originally planned as
> redundant observers but were removed (spec S-04, S-05). The daemon's
> multi-rig event poll + stranded scan provide sufficient coverage.

## Auto-convoy creation: what `gt sling` actually does

`gt sling` auto-creates a convoy for every bead it dispatches, unless
`--no-convoy` is passed. The behavior differs significantly between
single-bead and multi-bead (batch) sling.

### Single-bead sling

```
gt sling sh-task-1 gastown
```

1. Checks if `sh-task-1` is already tracked by an open convoy.
2. If not tracked: creates one auto-convoy `"Work: <issue-title>"` tracking
   that single bead.
3. Spawns one polecat, hooks the bead, starts working.

Result: 1 bead, 1 convoy, 1 polecat.

### Batch sling (3+ args, rig auto-resolved)

```
gt sling gt-task-1 gt-task-2 gt-task-3
```

The rig is auto-resolved from the beads' prefixes via `routes.jsonl`
(`resolveRigFromBeadIDs` in `sling_batch.go`). All beads must resolve
to the same rig. An explicit rig arg still works but prints a
deprecation warning:

```
gt sling gt-task-1 gt-task-2 gt-task-3 gastown
# Deprecation: gt sling now auto-resolves the rig from bead prefixes.
#              You no longer need to explicitly specify <gastown>.
```

**Batch sling creates one convoy tracking all beads.** Before spawning
any polecats, `runBatchSling` (`sling_batch.go`) calls
`createBatchConvoy` (`sling_convoy.go`) which creates a single convoy
with title `"Batch: N beads to <rig>"` and adds `tracks` deps for all
beads.

Result: 3 beads, **1 convoy**, 3 polecats -- all dispatched in parallel
with 2-second delays between spawns.

The convoy ID and merge strategy are stored on each bead via
`beadFieldUpdates`, so `gt done` can find the convoy via the fast path.

There is no upper limit on the number of beads. `gt sling <10 beads>`
spawns 10 polecats sharing 1 convoy. The only throttle is
`--max-concurrent` (default 0 = unlimited).

### Rig resolution errors

When the rig is explicit, the cross-rig guard checks each bead's prefix
against the target rig. On mismatch, it errors with batch-specific
suggested actions (remove the bead, sling it separately, or `--force`).

When auto-resolving, `resolveRigFromBeadIDs` errors if:
- A bead has no valid prefix
- A prefix is not mapped in `routes.jsonl` (including town-level `path="."`)
- Beads resolve to different rigs (lists each bead's rig, suggests slinging separately)

### Already-tracked bead conflict

If any bead in the batch is already tracked by another convoy, batch
sling **errors** before spawning any polecats. It prints:

- Which bead conflicts and which convoy it belongs to
- All beads in the existing convoy with their statuses
- The conflicting bead highlighted
- 4 recommended actions (remove from batch, move bead, close old convoy, add to existing)

### Initial dispatch vs daemon feeding

- **Initial dispatch is parallel.** All beads get polecats sequentially
  with 2-second delays between spawns, but they all dispatch in the same
  batch sling call regardless of deps. Even if `gt-task-2` has a `blocks`
  dep on `gt-task-1`, both get slung. The `isIssueBlocked` check only
  applies to daemon-driven convoy feeding (after a close event), not to
  the initial batch sling dispatch.
- **Subsequent feeding respects deps.** When a task closes, the daemon's
  event-driven feeder checks `IsSlingableType` and `isIssueBlocked`
  before dispatching the next ready issue from the shared convoy.

### No-convoy mode

Batch sling with `--no-convoy` skips convoy creation entirely:

```
gt sling gt-task-1 gt-task-2 gt-task-3 gastown --no-convoy
```

---

## Problem Statement

Convoys are passive trackers. They group work but don't drive it. The completion
loop has a structural gap:

```
Create → Assign → Execute → Issues close → ??? → Convoy closes
```

The `???` is "Deacon patrol runs `gt convoy check`" - a poll-based single point of
failure. When Deacon is down, convoys don't close. Work completes but the loop
never lands.

## Current State

### What Works
- Convoy creation and issue tracking
- `gt convoy status` shows progress
- `gt convoy stranded` finds unassigned work
- `gt convoy check` auto-closes completed convoys

### What Breaks
1. **Poll-based completion**: Only Deacon runs `gt convoy check`
2. **No event-driven trigger**: Issue close doesn't propagate to convoy
3. **Manual close is inconsistent across docs**: `gt convoy close --force` exists, but some docs still describe it as missing
4. **Single observer**: No redundant completion detection
5. **Weak notification**: Convoy owner not always clear

## Design: Active Convoy Convergence

### Principle: Event-Driven, Centrally Managed

Convoy completion should be:
1. **Event-driven**: Triggered by issue close, not polling
2. **Centrally managed**: Single owner (daemon) avoids scattered side-effect hooks
3. **Manually overridable**: Humans can force-close

### Event-Driven Completion

When an issue closes, check if it's tracked by a convoy:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    close["Issue closes"] --> tracked{"Tracked by convoy?"}
    tracked -->|No| done1(["Done"])
    tracked -->|Yes| check["Run gt convoy check"]
    check --> all{"All tracked<br/>issues closed?"}
    all -->|No| done2(["Done"])
    all -->|Yes| notify["Close convoy +<br/>send notifications"]
```

**Implementation**: The daemon's `ConvoyManager` event poll detects close events
via SDK `GetAllEventsSince` across all rig stores + hq. This catches all closes
regardless of source (CLI, witness, refinery, manual).

### Observer: Daemon ConvoyManager

The daemon's `ConvoyManager` is the sole convoy observer, running two
independent goroutines:

| Loop | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Event poll** | `GetAllEventsSince` every 5s (all rig stores + hq) | Detects close events, calls `CheckConvoysForIssue` |
| **Stranded scan** | `gt convoy stranded --json` every 30s | Feeds first ready issue via `gt sling`, auto-closes empty convoys |

Both loops are context-cancellable. The shared `CheckConvoysForIssue` function
is idempotent — closing an already-closed convoy is a no-op.

> **History**: The original design called for three redundant observers (Daemon,
> Witness, Refinery) per the "Redundant Monitoring Is Resilience" principle.
> Witness observers were removed (spec S-04) because convoy tracking is
> orthogonal to polecat lifecycle management. Refinery observers were removed
> (spec S-05) after S-17 found they were silently broken (wrong root path) with
> no visible impact, confirming single-observer coverage is sufficient.

### Issue-to-Rig Resolution

Convoys are rig-agnostic. A convoy like `hq-cv-6vjz2` lives in the hq store and
tracks issue IDs like `sh-pb6sa` — but it doesn't store which rig that issue
belongs to. The rig association is resolved at dispatch time via two lookups:

1. **Extract prefix**: `sh-pb6sa` → `sh-` (string parsing)
2. **Resolve rig**: look up `sh-` in `~/gt/.beads/routes.jsonl` → finds
   `{"prefix":"sh-","path":"gastown/.beads"}` → rig name is `gastown`

This happens in `feedFirstReady` (stranded scan path) and `feedNextReadyIssue`
(event poll path) just before calling `gt sling`. Issues with prefixes that
don't appear in `routes.jsonl` (or that map to `path="."` like `hq-*`) are
skipped — see `isSlingableBead()`.

Both paths check `isRigParked` after resolving the rig name. Issues targeting
parked rigs are logged and skipped rather than dispatched.

### Manual Close Command

`gt convoy close` is implemented, including `--force` for abandoned convoys.

```bash
# Close a completed convoy
gt convoy close hq-cv-abc

# Force-close an abandoned convoy
gt convoy close hq-cv-xyz --reason="work done differently"

# Close with explicit notification
gt convoy close hq-cv-abc --notify mayor/
```

Use cases:
- Abandoned convoys no longer relevant
- Work completed outside tracked path
- Force-closing stuck convoys

### Convoy Owner/Requester

Track who requested the convoy for targeted notifications:

```bash
gt convoy create "Feature X" gt-abc --owner mayor/ --notify overseer
```

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `owner` | Who requested (gets completion notification) |
| `notify` | Additional subscribers |

If `owner` not specified, defaults to creator (from `created_by`).

### Convoy States

```
OPEN ──(all issues close)──► CLOSED
  │                             │
  │                             ▼
  │                    (add issues)
  │                             │
  └─────────────────────────────┘
         (auto-reopens)
```

Adding issues to closed convoy reopens automatically.

**New state for abandonment:**

```
OPEN ──► CLOSED (completed)
  │
  └────► ABANDONED (force-closed without completion)
```

### Timeout/SLA (Future)

Optional `due_at` field for convoy deadline:

```bash
gt convoy create "Sprint work" gt-abc --due="2026-01-15"
```

Overdue convoys surface in `gt convoy stranded --overdue`.

## Commands

### Current: `gt convoy close`

```bash
gt convoy close <convoy-id> [--reason=<reason>] [--notify=<agent>]
```

- Verifies tracked issues are complete by default
- `--force` closes even when tracked issues remain open
- Sets `close_reason` field
- Sends notification to owner and subscribers
- Idempotent - closing closed convoy is no-op

### Enhanced: `gt convoy check`

```bash
# Check all convoys (current behavior)
gt convoy check

# Check specific convoy (new)
gt convoy check <convoy-id>

# Dry-run mode
gt convoy check --dry-run
```

### Future: `gt convoy reopen`

```bash
gt convoy reopen <convoy-id>
```

Explicit reopen for clarity (currently implicit via add).

## Implementation Status

Core convoy manager is fully implemented and tested (see [spec.md](spec.md)
stories S-01 through S-18, all DONE). Remaining future work:

1. **P2: Owner field** - targeted notifications polish
2. **P3: Timeout/SLA** - deadline tracking
