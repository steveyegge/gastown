{"id":"ga-xam","title":"gt and bd agent ID parsing incompatibility","description":"GitHub issue #78: gt creates agent IDs like gt-webapp-claude-code-polecat-ace, but bd can't parse which part is prefix vs rig when there are multiple hyphens.\n\nSymptoms:\n- 'unexpected end of JSON input' when parsing bd show output\n- 'no issue found matching' errors for agent beads\n- Agent state tracking is broken (warnings are non-fatal, work still completes)\n\nRoot cause: Format parsing bug - bd can't determine prefix boundaries with hyphenated rig names.\n\nOptions to fix:\n1. Fix gt - change how it generates agent IDs\n2. Fix bd - make parser smarter about hyphenated rigs\n3. Use a different delimiter (underscore, colon) for agent ID components\n\nRef: https://github.com/steveyegge/gastown/issues/78","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-05T06:45:58.218142-08:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-05T06:45:58.218142-08:00"}
