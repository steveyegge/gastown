// Package polecat provides polecat lifecycle management.
package polecat

import "time"

// State represents the current lifecycle state of a polecat.
//
// Polecat identity is persistent, but clean completion retires the live session.
// The primary operating states are:
//
//   - Working: Session active, doing assigned work (normal operation)
//   - Idle: Available before assignment, with no pending completion cleanup
//   - Done: Work completed, session retired, cleanup/refinery still owns state
//   - ReviewNeeded: Session is live but no active work bead is attached
//   - Stalled: Session stopped unexpectedly, was never nudged back to life
//   - Zombie: Session called 'gt done' but cleanup failed - tried to die but couldn't
//
// The distinction matters: idle polecats are available capacity. Done polecats
// completed work and are waiting for cleanup/refinery state to clear. Stalled
// polecats failed mid-work. Zombies tried to exit but couldn't complete cleanup.
//
// Note: These are LIFECYCLE states. The polecat IDENTITY (CV chain, mailbox,
// work history) persists across sessions. Worktrees persist only while active
// or awaiting cleanup; they are not reused after clean completion with pending state.
//
// "Stalled", "zombie", and related conditions are detected at query time by
// cross-checking tmux session liveness against beads state. The Witness also
// detects them through monitoring (tmux state, age in StateDone, etc.).

	StateIdle State = "idle"

	// StateDone means the polecat has completed its assigned work and called
	// 'gt done'. This is normally a transient state - the session should exit
	// immediately after. If a polecat remains in StateDone, it's a "zombie":
	// the cleanup failed and the session is stuck.
	StateDone State = "done"

	// StateReviewNeeded means a tmux session is still live but no current hooked
	// or assigned work bead exists, and cleanup status is not clean enough to
	// reuse safely. This prevents reporting "working" with Issue:none without
	// making the slot reusable before recovery decides what to do with the branch.

	// StateStalled means the polecat's tmux session has died while work was still
	// assigned. This is a detected condition: beads report the polecat as working
	// (hooked bead, assigned issue) but the tmux session is gone or the agent
	// process is dead. This typically happens after disk space exhaustion, OOM,
	// or other system failures that kill sessions without cleanup.
	// Unlike "stuck" (polecat self-reports), stalled is detected externally.
	StateStalled State = "stalled"

	// StateBlocked means the polecat holds work and its tmux session is alive,
	// but the agent inside it cannot act: the agent process is gone, the pane has
	// produced no output at all for NoProgressTimeout, or the pane carries a
	// provider error (expired credential, exhausted quota) that will refuse every
	// prompt. Detected externally, like "stalled", but the remedy differs — the
	// session does not need respawning, the operator needs to unblock the agent.
	//
	// This exists because a session that EXISTS is not a session that WORKS
	// (hq-3l8r): three rho polecats sat at an idle prompt on a dead Codex token
	// for six hours while `gt polecat list` reported all of them working.
