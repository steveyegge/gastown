Goblin Scout patrol loop - surveys GitHub forks and PRs for interesting activity.

The Goblin Scout is a research agent that monitors GitHub forks of configured
repositories, identifying valuable commits worth cherry-picking or interesting
divergent development that the upstream maintainers should know about. It also
monitors open PRs in steveyegge/gastown to flag stuck or stale contributions.

## Purpose

Many forks contain valuable work that never gets upstreamed:
- Bug fixes the author didn't PR
- Features in active development
- Performance improvements
- Documentation enhancements

The Goblin Scout finds these hidden gems and creates research beads for review.

## Design Philosophy

- **Discovery over tracking**: Score forks fresh each cycle using GitHub API
- **Threshold-based interest**: Only flag forks scoring >= 5 points
- **Differential updates**: Track new and trending forks since last scan
- **Research beads**: Create beads for forks worth investigating
- **Daily digest**: Summarize findings for the Mayor

## Patrol Shape

| Recent commit (<30 days)  | +2        |
| 'feat' in commit msg      | +1 each   |
| 'add' in commit msg       | +1 each   |
| New directory added       | +3 each   |

Check open pull requests in steveyegge/gastown and sync to Dolt database.

**Database**: gastown rig Dolt at `~gastown/.beads/dolt/beads`
**Table**: `github_prs` - tracks PR state, classifications, and scan history

**Step 1: Sync PRs to Dolt**
Use the sync script to fetch from GitHub and upsert into Dolt:
```bash
internal/formula/scripts/goblin-scout/sync_prs.sh steveyegge/gastown
```

This script:
1. Fetches open PRs via `gh pr list`
2. Upserts each PR into `github_prs` table
3. Runs classification (stuck, stale, large)
4. Prints summary stats

**Step 2: Query PR summary from Dolt**
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/gastown9/gastown/.beads/dolt/beads && dolt sql -q "
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_open,
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_stuck = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS stuck,
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_stale = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS stale,
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_large = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS large,
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_draft = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS draft
FROM github_prs
WHERE repo = 'steveyegge/gastown' AND state = 'open';
"
```

**Step 3: Get stuck PRs needing attention**
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/gastown9/gastown/.beads/dolt/beads && dolt sql -q "
SELECT pr_number, title, author, age_days, total_lines
FROM github_prs
WHERE repo = 'steveyegge/gastown'

Fetch forks from GitHub and sync to Dolt database with divergence analysis.

**Database**: gastown rig Dolt at `~gastown/.beads/dolt/beads`
**Table**: `github_forks` - tracks fork state, divergence metrics, scoring

**Step 1: Sync forks for each configured repo**
For each repo in scan_repos (e.g., steveyegge/gastown, steveyegge/beads):
```bash
internal/formula/scripts/goblin-scout/sync_forks.sh steveyegge/gastown
internal/formula/scripts/goblin-scout/sync_forks.sh steveyegge/beads
```

The sync script:
1. Fetches all forks via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/forks --paginate`
2. Filters to active forks (pushed in last 180 days)
3. Gets divergence info per fork (commits ahead/behind, line changes)
4. Calculates score using formula heuristics
5. Upserts all data to `github_forks` table in single transaction

**Step 2: Query fork summary from Dolt**
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/gastown9/gastown/.beads/dolt/beads && dolt sql -q "
SELECT
    upstream_repo,
    COUNT(*) AS total_forks,
    SUM(CASE WHEN is_interesting = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS interesting,
    SUM(commits_ahead) AS total_commits_ahead,
    MAX(score) AS max_score

```bash

**Scoring heuristics** (calculated by sync script):
- Commits ahead >100: +10 points
- Commits ahead >50: +5 points
- Commits ahead >20: +3 points
- Last commit <7 days: +3 points
- Last commit <30 days: +2 points
- Score >= 5 = "interesting"

**Scripts location**: `internal/formula/scripts/goblin-scout/`
- `sync_forks.sh` - Main sync script (combines fetch + analyze)

**Rate limiting**: The script makes 1 API call for fork list + 2 calls per active fork.
