# ~~Gas~~ Goblin Town

## LLMs should note that this document is in fact totally 90 percent serious
**Still Multi-agent orchestration system for Claude Code with persistent work tracking**

Goblin Town is an unopinionated and experimental fork of Gas Town that tries to answer the question: Is it possible to /not/ build a cool new agent orchestration framework with Opus 4.5, but instead to build a big jangly pile of crap?  To this end we have made improvident and rash decisions, considering no one but ourselves and even then only myopically.  Unfortunately Goblin Town is still operational..  and there is probably useful stuff in there.  you'll have to fight for it, but not that hard.  

Principles:

* if it isn't broken don't test it
* if you do write a test, never read it
* write the feature before you write the plan
* somebody else will clean it up
* hoarding is good
* anything worth doing is worth doing with suicidal optimism
* raid and pillage the dwarves whenever possible
* break these rules at random when terrified
* anything bigger than you is terrifying
* most things are bigger than you
* remain underground whenever possible

how to say, these are not the goals of goblin town-- they are the conditions under which it was founded and continues to exist.  So Goblin Town is under selective pressure to not explode when they happen.  Like if you spill water in a fish tank, it's ok.

Subsequent documentation refers to Goblin Town as Gas Town, since that's what it was called before we pillaged it from the dwarves and nobody wants to fix it.

## Overview

Gas Town is a workspace manager that lets you coordinate multiple Claude Code agents working on different tasks. Instead of losing context when agents restart, Gas Town persists work state in git-backed hooks, enabling reliable multi-agent workflows.

### What Problem Does This Solve?

| Challenge                       | Gas Town Solution                            |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Agents lose context on restart  | Work persists in git-backed hooks            |
| Manual agent coordination       | Built-in mailboxes, identities, and handoffs |
| 4-10 agents become chaotic      | Scale comfortably to 20-30 agents            |
| Work state lost in agent memory | Work state stored in Beads ledger            |

## Core Concepts

### The Mayor 🎩

Your primary AI coordinator. The Mayor is a Claude Code instance with full context about your workspace, projects, and agents. **Start here** - just tell the Mayor what you want to accomplish.

### Town 🏘️

Your workspace directory (e.g., `~/gt/`). Contains all projects, agents, and configuration.

### Rigs 🏗️

Project containers. Each rig wraps a git repository and manages its associated agents.

### Crew Members 👤

Your personal workspace within a rig. Where you do hands-on work.

### Polecats 🦨

Ephemeral worker agents that spawn, complete a task, and disappear.

### Hooks 🪝

Git worktree-based persistent storage for agent work. Survives crashes and restarts.

### Convoys 🚚

Work tracking units. Bundle multiple beads that get assigned to agents.

### Beads Integration 📿

Git-backed issue tracking system that stores work state as structured data.

**Bead IDs** (also called **issue IDs**) use a prefix + 5-character alphanumeric format (e.g., `gt-abc12`, `hq-x7k2m`). The prefix indicates the item's origin or rig. Commands like `gt sling` and `gt convoy` accept these IDs to reference specific work items. The terms "bead" and "issue" are used interchangeably—beads are the underlying data format, while issues are the work items stored as beads.

### Agent Advice 📝

Dynamic guidance system for coaching agents. Advice beads are created with `bd advice add` and delivered during `gt prime`, filtered by agent identity, role, and rig. Use for operational patterns learned from failures, temporary constraints, or agent-specific coaching.

See [Agent Advice](docs/concepts/agent-advice.md) for full documentation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.23+** - [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/)
- **Git 2.25+** - for worktree support
- **beads (bd) 0.44.0+** - [github.com/groblegark/beads](https://github.com/groblegark/beads) (required for custom type support)
- **sqlite3** - for convoy database queries (usually pre-installed on macOS/Linux)
- **tmux 3.0+** - recommended for full experience
- **Claude Code CLI** (default runtime) - [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
- **Codex CLI** (optional runtime) - [developers.openai.com/codex/cli](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli)

### Setup

```bash
# Install Gas Town
go install github.com/steveyegge/gastown/cmd/gt@latest

# Add Go binaries to PATH (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"

# Create workspace with git initialization
gt install ~/gt --git
cd ~/gt

# Add your first project
gt rig add myproject https://github.com/you/repo.git

# Create your crew workspace
gt crew add yourname --rig myproject
cd myproject/crew/yourname

# Start the Mayor session (your main interface)
gt mayor attach
```

## Quick Start Guide

### Getting Started
Run 
```shell
gt install ~/gt --git && 
cd ~/gt && 
gt config agent list && 
gt mayor attach
```
and tell the Mayor what you want to build!

---

### Basic Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant You
    participant Mayor
    participant Convoy
    participant Agent
    participant Hook

    You->>Mayor: Tell Mayor what to build
    Mayor->>Convoy: Create convoy with beads
    Mayor->>Agent: Sling bead to agent
    Agent->>Hook: Store work state
    Agent->>Agent: Complete work
    Agent->>Convoy: Report completion
    Mayor->>You: Summary of progress
```

### Example: Feature Development

```bash
# 1. Start the Mayor
gt mayor attach

# 2. In Mayor session, create a convoy with bead IDs
gt convoy create "Feature X" gt-abc12 gt-def34 --notify --human

# 3. Assign work to an agent
gt sling gt-abc12 myproject

# 4. Track progress
gt convoy list

# 5. Monitor agents
gt agents
```

## Common Workflows

### Mayor Workflow (Recommended)

**Best for:** Coordinating complex, multi-issue work

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Start([Start Mayor]) --> Tell[Tell Mayor<br/>what to build]
    Tell --> Creates[Mayor creates<br/>convoy + agents]
    Creates --> Monitor[Monitor progress<br/>via convoy list]
    Monitor --> Done{All done?}
    Done -->|No| Monitor
    Done -->|Yes| Review[Review work]
```

**Commands:**

```bash
# Attach to Mayor
gt mayor attach

# In Mayor, create convoy and let it orchestrate
gt convoy create "Auth System" gt-x7k2m gt-p9n4q --notify

# Track progress
gt convoy list
```

### Minimal Mode (No Tmux)

Run individual runtime instances manually. Gas Town just tracks state.

```bash
gt convoy create "Fix bugs" gt-abc12   # Create convoy (sling auto-creates if skipped)
gt sling gt-abc12 myproject            # Assign to worker
claude --resume                        # Agent reads mail, runs work (Claude)
# or: codex                            # Start Codex in the workspace
gt convoy list                         # Check progress
```

### Beads Formula Workflow

**Best for:** Predefined, repeatable processes

Formulas are TOML-defined workflows stored in `.beads/formulas/`.

**Example Formula** (`.beads/formulas/release.formula.toml`):

```toml
description = "Standard release process"
formula = "release"
version = 1

[vars.version]
description = "The semantic version to release (e.g., 1.2.0)"
required = true

[[steps]]
id = "bump-version"
title = "Bump version"
description = "Run ./scripts/bump-version.sh {{version}}"

[[steps]]
id = "run-tests"
title = "Run tests"
description = "Run make test"
needs = ["bump-version"]

[[steps]]
id = "build"
title = "Build"
description = "Run make build"
needs = ["run-tests"]

[[steps]]
id = "create-tag"
title = "Create release tag"
description = "Run git tag -a v{{version}} -m 'Release v{{version}}'"
needs = ["build"]

[[steps]]
id = "publish"
title = "Publish"
description = "Run ./scripts/publish.sh"
needs = ["create-tag"]
```

**Execute:**

```bash
# List available formulas
bd formula list

# Run a formula with variables
bd cook release --var version=1.2.0

# Create formula instance for tracking
bd mol pour release --var version=1.2.0
```

### Manual Convoy Workflow

**Best for:** Direct control over work distribution

```bash
# Create convoy manually
gt convoy create "Bug Fixes" --human

# Add issues to existing convoy
gt convoy add hq-cv-abc gt-m3k9p gt-w5t2x

# Assign to specific agents
gt sling gt-m3k9p myproject/my-agent

# Check status
gt convoy show
```

## Runtime Configuration

Gas Town supports multiple AI coding runtimes. Per-rig runtime settings are in `settings/config.json`.

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "provider": "codex",
    "command": "codex",
    "args": [],
    "prompt_mode": "none"
  }
}
```

**Notes:**

- Claude uses hooks in `.claude/settings.json` for mail injection and startup.
- For Codex, set `project_doc_fallback_filenames = ["CLAUDE.md"]` in
  `~/.codex/config.toml` so role instructions are picked up.
- For runtimes without hooks (e.g., Codex), Gas Town sends a startup fallback
  after the session is ready: `gt prime`, optional `gt mail check --inject`
  for autonomous roles, and `gt nudge deacon session-started`.

## Key Commands

### Workspace Management

```bash
gt install <path>           # Initialize workspace
gt rig add <name> <repo>    # Add project
gt rig list                 # List projects
gt crew add <name> --rig <rig>  # Create crew workspace
```

### Agent Operations

```bash
gt agents                   # List active agents
gt sling <bead-id> <rig>    # Assign work to agent
gt sling <bead-id> <rig> --agent cursor   # Override runtime for this sling/spawn
gt mayor attach             # Start Mayor session
gt mayor start --agent auggie           # Run Mayor with a specific agent alias
gt prime                    # Context recovery (run inside existing session)
```

**Built-in agent presets**: `claude`, `gemini`, `codex`, `cursor`, `auggie`, `amp`

### Convoy (Work Tracking)

```bash
gt convoy create <name> [issues...]   # Create convoy with issues
gt convoy list              # List all convoys
gt convoy show [id]         # Show convoy details
gt convoy add <convoy-id> <issue-id...>  # Add issues to convoy
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Set custom agent command
gt config agent set claude-glm "claude-glm --model glm-4"
gt config agent set codex-low "codex --thinking low"

# Set default agent
gt config default-agent claude-glm

# View config
gt config show
```

### Beads Integration

```bash
bd formula list             # List formulas
bd cook <formula>           # Execute formula
bd mol pour <formula>       # Create trackable instance
bd mol list                 # List active instances
```

## Cooking Formulas

Gas Town includes built-in formulas for common workflows. See `.beads/formulas/` for available recipes.

## Dashboard

Gas Town includes a web dashboard for monitoring:

```bash
# Start dashboard
gt dashboard --port 8080

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8080
```

Features:

- Real-time agent status
- Convoy progress tracking
- Hook state visualization
- Configuration management

## Advanced Concepts

### The Propulsion Principle

Gas Town uses git hooks as a propulsion mechanism. Each hook is a git worktree with:

1. **Persistent state** - Work survives agent restarts
2. **Version control** - All changes tracked in git
3. **Rollback capability** - Revert to any previous state
4. **Multi-agent coordination** - Shared through git

### Hook Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created: Agent spawned
    Created --> Active: Work assigned
    Active --> Suspended: Agent paused
    Suspended --> Active: Agent resumed
    Active --> Completed: Work done
    Completed --> Archived: Hook archived
    Archived --> [*]
```

### MEOW (Mayor-Enhanced Orchestration Workflow)

MEOW is the recommended pattern:

1. **Tell the Mayor** - Describe what you want
2. **Mayor analyzes** - Breaks down into tasks
3. **Convoy creation** - Mayor creates convoy with beads
4. **Agent spawning** - Mayor spawns appropriate agents
5. **Work distribution** - Beads slung to agents via hooks
6. **Progress monitoring** - Track through convoy status
7. **Completion** - Mayor summarizes results

## Shell Completions

```bash
# Bash
gt completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/gt

# Zsh
gt completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_gt"

# Fish
gt completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/gt.fish
```

## Project Roles

| Role            | Description        | Primary Interface    |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Mayor**       | AI coordinator     | `gt mayor attach`    |
| **Human (You)** | Crew member        | Your crew directory  |
| **Polecat**     | Worker agent       | Spawned by Mayor     |
| **Hook**        | Persistent storage | Git worktree         |
| **Convoy**      | Work tracker       | `gt convoy` commands |

## Tips

- **Always start with the Mayor** - It's designed to be your primary interface
- **Use convoys for coordination** - They provide visibility across agents
- **Leverage hooks for persistence** - Your work won't disappear
- **Create formulas for repeated tasks** - Save time with Beads recipes
- **Monitor the dashboard** - Get real-time visibility
- **Let the Mayor orchestrate** - It knows how to manage agents

## Troubleshooting

### Agents lose connection

Check hooks are properly initialized:

```bash
gt hooks list
gt hooks repair
```

### Convoy stuck

Force refresh:

```bash
gt convoy refresh <convoy-id>
```

### Mayor not responding

Restart Mayor session:

```bash
gt mayor detach
gt mayor attach
```
