Mail is just:\n- Handoffs (agent → self)\n- Commands (Mayor → Refinery)\n- Escalations (Witness → Mayor)\n\nThese can all be beads issues with a special prefix.\n\n## Design\n\n### Convention\n- Messages use `@-` prefix: `@-witness-1734012345`\n- Assignee = recipient\n- Status: open = unread, closed = read/acknowledged\n- Priority 0 = urgent\n\n### Commands (thin wrappers)\n```bash\ngt mail send witness -s \"Subject\" -m \"Body\"\n  → bd create --prefix=@ --title=\"Subject\" --assignee=witness --description=\"Body\"\n\ngt mail inbox\n  → bd list --prefix=@ --assignee=$(gt whoami) --status=open\n\ngt mail read @-abc\n  → bd show @-abc \u0026\u0026 bd close @-abc\n```\n\n### Notification\nDaemon watches for new `@-` issues and pokes relevant sessions.\nOr: agents poll on heartbeat (simpler).\n\n## What We Remove\n- `mail/inbox.jsonl` files\n- Mail JSONL read/write code\n- Separate delivery mechanism\n\n## What We Keep\n- `gt mail` CLI (as wrapper)\n- Handoff semantics\n- Notification (via daemon or polling)\n\n## Benefits\n- One system, one sync, one query interface\n- All communication in git history\n- Simpler architecture\n\n## Risks\n- Beads prefix filtering must be efficient\n- Namespace collision with user prefixes\n- Performance for high-frequency messages (probably fine for handoffs)\n\n## Decision Point\nDo we need first-class mail support in beads (`bd mail` commands) or is convention sufficient?","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-16T02:10:18.32879-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-25T01:30:41.67682-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-25T01:30:41.67682-08:00","deleted_by":"batch delete","delete_reason":"batch delete","original_type":"task"}

Move spawn-only flags to sling\n\n| Flag | Current | Action |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| `--naked` | spawn only | Move to sling |\n| `--create` | spawn only | Move to sling |\n| `--molecule` | spawn only | Move to sling |\n| `--force` | spawn only | Move to sling |\n| `--account` | spawn only | Move to sling |\n| `--no-start` | spawn only | Evaluate if needed |\n\n### 2. Remove top-level gt spawn\n\n- Keep `gt spawn pending` as subcommand if still needed\n- Remove `gt spawn` from root commands\n- Update all docs and CLAUDE.md references\n\n### 3.

Add `gate` issue type to beads\n2. Add gate fields: await_type, await_id, timeout, waiters\n3. Implement `bd gate create/show/list/close/wait` commands\n4. Add gate checking to Deacon patrol loop\n5. Implement await type handlers (gh:run, gh:pr, timer, human, mail)\n6. Add gate timeout tracking and notification\n7. Integration test: agent waits for CI via gate\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- Should gates live in wisp storage or main storage with wisp flag?\n- Do we need a gate catalog (like molecule catalog)?\n- Should `waits-for` dep type work with gates?","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-24T19:19:17.774543-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.572647-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.572647-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

Molecules don't get a separate YAML format - they're issues with `type: molecule` containing prose-based step definitions.\n\nAgents don't need rigid schemas. They parse natural language natively.

{"id":"gt-5gq8r","title":"gt mol step done: Auto-continue molecule on step completion","description":"## Summary\n\nImplement `gt mol step done \u003cstep-id\u003e` command that enables polecats to close a molecule step and automatically continue to the next step without waiting for witness orchestration.\n\n## Problem\n\nCurrently, when a polecat completes a molecule step:\n1. Polecat sends POLECAT_DONE to witness\n2. Witness (in patrol cycle) eventually reads mail\n3. Witness spawns next step\n4. **Minutes of latency possible**\n\nPolecats also forget to close beads steps (using internal TodoWrite instead), breaking the activity feed.\n\n## Solution\n\n`gt mol step done \u003cstep-id\u003e` handles everything:\n\n1. Close the beads step (`bd close \u003cstep-id\u003e`)\n2. Extract molecule ID from step (bd-mol-xga.1 → bd-mol-xga)\n3. Find next ready step (dependency-aware)\n4. If next step exists:\n   - Update hook file to point to next step\n   - Write handoff context\n   - tmux respawn-pane (fresh claude session)\n5. If molecule complete:\n   - Clear hook\n   - Send POLECAT_DONE to witness\n   - Exit session\n\n## Key Insight\n\nStep-to-step transitions are **mechanical**, not **cognitive**. No AI needed in the critical path. Pure Go automation.\n\n## Related Commands\n\n- `gt mol next \u003cmol-id\u003e` - Show next ready step(s)\n- `gt mol progress \u003cmol-id\u003e` - Already exists\n\n## Polecat Protocol Update\n\n```markdown\nWhen your hook contains a molecule step:\n1. Read the step: `bd show \u003cstep-id\u003e`\n2. Execute the work described\n3. When complete: `gt mol step done \u003cstep-id\u003e`\n\nThat is it. Do NOT manually close steps. Do NOT work multiple steps.\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Instant step transitions** (~5-10s vs minutes)\n- **Activity feed works** (steps closed as completed)\n- **Witness freed up** (safety net only, not critical path)\n- **Fresh context per step** (better attention, no accumulated confusion)\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-26T12:45:11.903532-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.908918-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.908918-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"feature"}

Deacon patrol: New step prime-pending-workers that:\n   - Scans all rigs for workers with pending_prime=true\n   - Uses WaitForClaudeReady() to poll for \"\u003e \" prompt (already exists in tmux.go)\n   - Once ready, sends gt prime + assignment nudge\n   - Clears pending_prime flag\n\n## Implementation\n\n### spawn.go changes\n- Remove the 3-second sleep (line 368)\n- Remove the NudgeSession call (lines 375-383)\n- Instead: Update polecat state with pending_prime=true\n\n### Polecat state addition\nstatus: assigned, pending_prime: true, issue: gt-xxx\n\n### Deacon patrol addition\nAdd step between inbox-check and plugin-run:\nprime-pending-workers: Check all rigs for workers marked pending_prime.\nFor each pending worker: WaitForClaudeReady(60s), then gt prime + nudge\n\n### Benefits\n- No race condition - we poll until actually ready\n- Deacon already does health checks - priming is natural fit\n- Works for polecats, witnesses, refineries, crew (unified approach)\n- Timeout handling built in\n\n## Depends on\n- Existing WaitForClaudeReady() in tmux.go (lines 384-403)","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-22T17:19:33.589909-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.124884-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.124884-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"gt-7918","title":"Patrols: Cyclic molecules for autonomous maintenance","description":"## Vision\n\nPatrols are **cyclic molecules** - workflow loops that give Gas Town its autonomous nervous system. While regular molecules are DAGs that terminate, patrols loop forever, performing maintenance tasks at varying cadences.\n\nThis is the \"steam engine\" of Gas Town: converting episodic Claude sessions into continuous autonomous operation.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### 1. Cyclic Molecules\n\nRegular molecule:     A -\u003e B -\u003e C -\u003e done\nPatrol molecule:      A -\u003e B -\u003e C --+\n                      ^             |\n                      +-------------+\n\nPatrols have a loop_to field specifying where to restart.\n\n### 2. Cooldown-Aware Steps (Atoms)\n\nSteps encode their own cadence. When patrol reaches a step:\n1. Check: now - last_run \u003e cooldown?\n2. If yes: execute, update last_run\n3. If no: skip (immediately close)\n\nThe patrol runner is simple - steps self-skip. Complexity distributed into atoms.\n\n### 3. The Beacon\n\nThe heartbeat that fires patrol triggers:\n- Internal ticker in Deacon (goroutine)\n- Or external cron firing gt deacon tick\n- Or mail-based triggers\n\nWithout beacon, nothing proactive happens.\n\n### 4. Session Reset as Patrol Step\n\nConnects to auto-handoff (gt-bcwn). Session reset is a patrol step, not a separate mechanism.\n\n### 5. Multi-Role Patrols\n\nEach supervisor has its own patrol:\n\n**Deacon patrol:** health-check (30s), session-gc (5m), beacon-tick (10s)\n**Witness patrol:** orphan-scan (10m), stuck-check (2m), molecule-progress (1m)\n**Refinery patrol:** queue-check (30s), pr-status (1m), merge-ready (30s)\n\n### 6. Cadence Tiers\n\n- Critical (10-30s): Health checks\n- Active (1-5m): Progress, nudges\n- Maintenance (10-30m): Orphans, GC\n- Periodic (1h+): Reports\n\n### 7. Best-Effort Scheduling\n\nNot real-time - more like cron. No hard deadlines. Catch-up, dont pile-up.\nPriority preemption (mail interrupts patrol). Graceful degradation under load.\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. State persistence: Beads (self-describing) or file (faster)?\n2. Interruption: How does urgent mail preempt patrol?\n3. Error recovery: Backoff? Escalate? Circuit breaker?\n4. Coordination: Can patrols send mail to trigger other patrols?\n\n## Related\n\n- gt-bcwn: Auto-handoff (session reset is a patrol step)\n- Molecule system (patrols extend molecules with loops)\n- Deacon lifecycle management\n\n## Metaphor\n\nClaude was fire. Claude Code was steam. Gas Town is the steam engine. Beads is the train tracks.\n\nThe steam engine converts episodic combustion into continuous rotary motion.\nGas Town converts episodic Claude sessions into continuous autonomous work.","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-21T12:18:22.99128-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.576866-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-7918","depends_on_id":"gt-bcwn","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-21T12:18:30.86651-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.576866-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

{"id":"gt-7920","title":"Create mol-refinery-patrol with test failure gates","description":"## Problem\n\nThe Refinery role lacks:\n1. A formal patrol molecule (Deacon has mol-deacon-patrol)\n2. Engineer identity/philosophy guidance\n3. Structural enforcement of failure handling (not just documentation)\n\nWhen tests fail during merge processing, the current guidance doesn't prevent 'disavowal' - noting a problem exists and proceeding without tracking it.\n\n## The Structural Solution\n\nCreate `mol-refinery-patrol` with **verification gates** that make disavowal structurally impossible:\n\n```markdown\n## Molecule: mol-refinery-patrol\n\n## Step: inbox-check\nCheck mail for MR submissions, escalations, messages.\nProcess any urgent items first.\n\n## Step: queue-scan\nFetch remote, identify polecat branches waiting.\nIf queue empty, skip to context-check.\nTrack branch list for this cycle.\nNeeds: inbox-check\n\n## Step: process-branch\nPick next branch. Rebase on current main.\nIf rebase conflicts: notify polecat, skip to next branch.\nNeeds: queue-scan\n\n## Step: run-tests\nRun go test ./...\nTrack results (pass/fail count).\nNeeds: process-branch\n\n## Step: handle-failures\n**GATE**: If tests passed, this step auto-completes.\nIf tests failed:\n- Diagnose: branch regression or pre-existing?\n- Branch regression → abort, notify polecat\n- Pre-existing → EITHER fix OR \\`bd create --type=bug\\`\n**VERIFY**: Fix committed OR bead filed before proceeding.\nNeeds: run-tests\n\n## Step: merge-push\nMerge to main (ff-only preferred).\nPush immediately.\nDelete polecat branch.\nNeeds: handle-failures\n\n## Step: loop-check\nMore branches? Return to process-branch.\nOtherwise continue to summary.\nNeeds: merge-push\n\n## Step: generate-summary\nSummarize cycle: branches processed, tests results, issues filed.\nNeeds: loop-check\n\n## Step: context-check\nCheck context usage.\nIf high: write handoff, prepare for burn/respawn.\nNeeds: generate-summary\n\n## Step: burn-or-loop\nIf context LOW and queue non-empty: loop (return to queue-scan)\nIf context HIGH or queue empty: burn and exit\nNeeds: context-check\n```\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Add RefineryPatrolMolecule() to builtin_molecules.go\n- Copy pattern from DeaconPatrolMolecule\n- Include all steps with proper `Needs:` dependencies\n- Emphasize handle-failures gate in description\n\n### 2. Update Refinery CLAUDE.md\nAdd sections:\n- **The Engineer Mindset** (identity/philosophy)\n- **The Scotty Test** (Would Scotty walk past this?)\n- **Patrol Molecule** reference (mol-refinery-patrol)\n- **Test Failure Protocol** (explicit decision tree)\n\n### 3. Create prompts/roles/refinery.md\n- Follow pattern of deacon.md\n- Include patrol execution loop diagram\n- Reference the molecule\n\n### 4. Consider mol-witness-patrol\n- Witness has detailed heartbeat protocol but no formal molecule\n- Similar pattern could apply\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nGUPP: 'If you have work on your hook, you have to run it.'\nThe patrol molecule puts failure handling ON THE HOOK as a mandatory step.\nYou can't skip handle-failures to get to merge-push.\nThe structure enforces good behavior.\n\n## Related\n- gt-7919: Fix failing beads tests (discovered during this session)\n- mol-deacon-patrol (existing pattern to follow)\n- docs/molecular-chemistry.md (chemistry concepts)\n- docs/wisp-architecture.md (wisp vs mol decision)","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-22T13:01:48.588945-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:25:59.95284-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:25:59.95284-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"feature"}

Add `gt handoff` command for polecats to request shutdown\n2. Modify gt spawn to always create fresh worktree\n3. Run bd init in new worktree (beads needs initialization)\n4. Add shutdown request handler to Witness\n5. Witness verifies handoff, then cleans up:\n   - Kill session\n   - Remove worktree\n   - Delete branch\n6. Remove 'idle' state from polecat state machine\n7. Simplify gt polecat list (only shows active)\n\n## Impact on Other Tasks\n\n- gt-17r (Zombie cleanup): Becomes trivial - orphan worktrees\n- gt-4my (Worker health): Simpler - no idle/stuck ambiguity\n- gt-f9x.5/f9x.6 (Doctor): Fewer states to validate\n- gt-eu9 (Witness handoff): Witness receives polecat shutdown requests","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-17T15:44:31.139964-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:54.27909-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:54.27909-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"feature"}

Verify harness structure (mayor/, .beads/, CLAUDE.md exist)\n2. Validate config files (town.json, rigs.json parse correctly)\n3. Check beads health (bd doctor, redirect validity)\n4. Verify git state (clean working tree, proper remotes)\n5. Check rig integrity (each registered rig exists, has config.json)\n6. Validate agent clones (mayor/rig/, refinery/rig/ exist and are valid)\n7. Check for orphaned worktrees/branches\n8.

Key findings:\n\n### Insight: Patrol Loop is OUTSIDE the Algebra\n\nThe daemon respawns patrols. Each formula describes ONE cycle. This means:\n- Formulas don't need \"infinite loop with burn-and-respawn\"\n- loop is only for **inner loops** (refinery's per-branch processing)\n- \"burn-or-loop\" = complete cycle; daemon decides next action\n- Context cycling is external, not algebraic\n\nThis significantly simplifies the algebra.\n\n### Gap: for-each is Missing\n\nThe current proposal doesn't include for-each, but it's essential for patrol patterns:\n\n| Pattern | Use Case |\n|---------|----------|\n| Witness survey-workers | For each polecat, bond an arm (parallel) |\n| Refinery process-branch | For each branch in queue, run merge pipeline (sequential) |\n| Deacon plugin-run | For each plugin where gate open, execute |\n\nProposed syntax:\n\n    for-each:\n      collection: \"survey-workers.output.polecats\"\n      bond: mol-polecat-arm\n      vars:\n        polecat_name: \"{item.name}\"\n      parallel: true\n\nThis overlaps with gt-8tmz.8 (runtime dynamic expansion). Decision needed:\n- Include for-each here as control flow, OR\n- Ensure gt-8tmz.8 covers these patterns adequately\n\n### Gap: waits-for Gate Variant\n\nThe \"fanout gate\" pattern (aggregate waits for all dynamically-bonded children)\nneeds formalization:\n\n    step: aggregate\n    waits-for: children-of(survey-workers)\n\nCurrently exists in formulas as waits_for: \"all-children\" but not in the algebra spec.\n\n### What This Covers\n\nWith these operators (plus for-each), patrols become fully expressible:\n\n**Witness Patrol:**\n- for-each polecat -\u003e bond mol-polecat-arm (parallel)\n- gate with waits-for: all-children for aggregation\n\n**Refinery Patrol:**\n- for-each branch -\u003e process pipeline (sequential)\n- gate for test verification before merge\n\n**Deacon Patrol:**\n- for-each plugin -\u003e execute if gate open\n- Simple sequence otherwise\n\n### Scope Decision\n\n**Option A**: Implement loop, gate, branch now.

The first .beads found is the one to use, and parent directories are out of scope.\n\n## Note\n\nThis is a beads issue, filed here for tracking.

{"id":"gt-ci84","title":"Deacon patrol wisps should use town beads, not gastown rig beads","description":"## Problem\n\nThe deacon is a town-level role but stores patrol wisps in gastown/mayor/rig/.beads/ (see internal/cmd/prime.go:691). This fails for users who don't have the gastown rig installed.\n\n## Correct Architecture\n\nDeacon -\u003e ~/gt/.beads-wisp/ (town-level, no rig dependency)\n\nTown-level ephemeral work (deacon patrols) should use town wisp storage, just like rig-level ephemeral work (witness/refinery patrols) uses rig wisp storage.\n\n## Implementation Tasks\n\n### 1. Town Setup (gt install / gt town init)\n\n- Create ~/gt/.beads-wisp/ directory during town initialization\n- Initialize as git repo (for local commits, not synced)\n- Add config.yaml with wisp: true\n- Ensure .beads-wisp/ is gitignored at town level\n\nFiles:\n- internal/cmd/install.go (or equivalent town init)\n- internal/town/manager.go (if exists)\n\n### 2. Rig Setup (gt rig init)\n\nAlready creates \u003crig\u003e/.beads-wisp/ - verify this is working:\n- internal/rig/manager.go:375 (beadsDir := filepath.Join(rigPath, \".beads-wisp\"))\n- internal/rig/manager.go:394 (ensureGitignoreEntry)\n\n### 3. Deacon Code Fixes\n\nUpdate deacon to use town wisp storage:\n- internal/cmd/prime.go:691 - change rigBeadsDir to townWispDir\n- internal/cmd/sling.go - route deacon wisps to town level\n- internal/daemon/daemon.go - any deacon-specific wisp handling\n\n### 4. gt doctor Checks\n\nAdd/update doctor checks for wisp directories:\n- internal/doctor/wisp_check.go - already checks rig wisps\n- Add TownWispCheck to verify ~/gt/.beads-wisp/ exists\n- Add TownWispGitCheck to verify it is a valid git repo\n- Update existing checks to handle both town and rig levels\n\nFiles:\n- internal/doctor/wisp_check.go (extend for town level)\n- internal/doctor/checks.go (register new checks)\n\n### 5. Documentation\n\n- docs/beads-data-plane.md - already updated with three-tier architecture\n- Verify wisp-architecture.md reflects town-level wisps\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Fresh gt install should create ~/gt/.beads-wisp/\n2. gt doctor should pass with no rig installed\n3. Deacon patrol should work without gastown rig\n4. gt sling patrol deacon/ --wisp should route to town wisps","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-23T14:28:03.636334-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.982224-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.982224-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"bug"}
{"id":"gt-cik","title":"Overseer Crew: User-managed persistent workspaces","description":"## Overview\n\nCrew workers are the overseer's (human's) personal workspaces within a rig. Unlike polecats which are witness-managed and ephemeral, crew workers are:\n\n- **Persistent**: Not auto-garbage-collected\n- **User-managed**: Overseer controls lifecycle\n- **Long-lived identities**: dave, emma, fred - recognizable names\n- **Gas Town integrated**: Mail, handoff mechanics work\n- **Tmux optional**: Can work in terminal directly\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\n\u003crig\u003e/\n  polecats/       # Managed workers (witness controls)\n  refinery/       # Merge queue processor\n  witness/        # Pit boss\n  crew/           # Overseer's personal workspaces\n    dave/         # Full clone, persistent\n    emma/         # Full clone, persistent\n    fred/         # Full clone, persistent\n```\n\n## Key Differences from Polecats\n\n- Location: crew/ instead of polecats/\n- Lifecycle: User-managed, not witness-managed\n- Auto-cleanup: Never (polecats auto-cleanup on swarm land)\n- Issue assignment: Optional (polecats require it)\n- Tmux: Optional (polecats require it)\n- Mail \u0026 Handoff: Yes for both\n- Identity: Persistent (polecats are ephemeral)\n\n## CLI Commands\n\n- gt crew add \u003cname\u003e [--rig \u003crig\u003e] - Create crew workspace\n- gt crew list [--rig \u003crig\u003e] - List crew workspaces\n- gt crew at \u003crig\u003e/\u003cname\u003e - Attach to workspace (start session)\n- gt crew attach \u003cname\u003e - Attach (infer rig from cwd)\n- gt crew refresh \u003cname\u003e - Handoff + restart (context cycling)\n- gt crew remove \u003cname\u003e [--force] - Remove workspace\n- gt crew status [\u003cname\u003e] - Show workspace status\n\n## Design Notes\n\n- Crew workers use full git clones (not worktrees)\n- Optional beads integration via BEADS_DIR\n- Mail-to-self handoff works for context cycling\n- No witness monitoring or nudging\n- No automatic issue assignment required\n\n## Background\n\nUsers often maintain separate repo clones for serial agent work.

Too many separate files.\n3. **Bottom-up** - Written as we built. Users need top-down.\n\nGas Town is a simple agent orchestrator (4-10 → 20-30 agents). Not a manifesto.\n\n## Target Structure\n\n### 1. Features at a Glance\n- Persistent agent identities with mail inboxes and \"work hooks\"\n- Sling work to agents, pinned to their hook\n- Universal Propulsion: If hook is pinned, RUN IT\n- Hooks survive crash, shutdown, compaction, restart\n- Self-sling for auto-restart workflows\n- Pin individual beads or entire epics\n\n### 2. Available Workflows\n- tmux mode vs no-tmux (raw Claude Code)\n- Full Gas Town vs partial (single roles)\n- Modular and resilient - one role at a time\n\n### 3. Cooking Formulas\n- Molecules = chains of issues (railroad tracks)\n- Formulas = step descriptions (atoms)\n- Cook formulas → molecules → durable workflows\n- Examples: release molecule, deacon patrol, polecat workflow, shiny\n\n### 4. (Optional) MEOW Deep Dive\n- Structured epics as chained work graphs\n- Serial/parallel branches, gates, loops, algebra\n- States of matter, polymorphic bond operators\n- But users just need to cook formulas\n\n## Deliverable\n\nOne README + maybe one or two supporting docs.

Embed formulas in `gt` binary\n\n```go\n//go:embed formulas/*.formula.json\nvar formulaFS embed.FS\n```\n\n### 2. Seed formulas during setup\n\n`gt install` and `gt rig init` write embedded formulas to `.beads/formulas/`.\n\n### 3. Hash-based staleness detection\n\n`gt doctor` checks:\n- CLAUDE.md hash vs embedded template hash\n- Formula files hash vs embedded formula hash\n\nIf stale → warn. `gt doctor --fix` refreshes.\n\n### 4.

Go should be message transport, not decision-maker.\n\n## The Fix\n\nMove all health/oversight logic to Deacon patrol molecule:\n- Deacon runs once per minute\n- Claude reads molecule steps, executes them\n- Claude decides if agents are stuck (by checking mail, activity, etc.)\n- Claude sends nudges/escalations via mail\n- Go just routes messages\n\n## Scope\n\n1. daemon/daemon.go - heartbeat staleness logic\n2. daemon/backoff.go - exponential backoff decisions\n3. daemon/lifecycle.go - regex parsing of lifecycle intent\n4. keepalive/keepalive.go - staleness thresholds\n5. deacon/heartbeat.go - heartbeat age classification\n6. doctor/stale_check.go - staleness detection\n7. polecat/manager.go - state derivation from issues\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Go code has no hardcoded time.Duration for health decisions\n- No regex parsing of mail subjects for intent\n- No switch statements deciding agent state\n- Deacon molecule has all oversight logic\n- Go daemon is just a message router","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-23T23:58:18.684884-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.754824-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.754824-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

This epic makes it PROACTIVE with a structured molecule:\n\n```\nDeacon Wake\n├── Step 0: Session Check (should I cycle myself?)\n├── Step 1: Health Scan (Mayor, Witnesses, Crew, Refineries)\n├── Step 2: Lifecycle Processing (cycle/restart/shutdown requests)\n├── Step 3: Plugin Execution (scheduled, event-triggered, human-requested)\n├── Step 4: Event Callbacks (timers, subscriptions)\n└── Step 5: Heartbeat + Wait\n```\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\n1. **Session cycling first** - Token costs are quadratic with session length.\n   Deacon should aggressively cycle to fresh sessions. First step of every\n   wake is \"do I need a new session?\" based on context budget.\n\n2. **Pinned bead with marching orders** - A pinned bead (like gt prime for\n   agents) defines the Deacon's rounds molecule. This is the Deacon's\n   \"kernel\" - its operating loop.\n\n3. **Keepalive file for daemon quieting** - Instead of daemon tmux-poking\n   the Deacon (which interrupts work), Deacon writes a keepalive file.\n   Daemon reads it and backs off. Worst case: Deacon forgets, gets one\n   extra heartbeat it squelches.\n\n4. **Molecule-based rounds** - The wake cycle becomes a molecule with steps.\n   Each step can have plugins (inline attention). Steps can be added/modified\n   by updating the pinned bead.\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\nGo Daemon (minimal, dumb)\n├── Reads {townRoot}/deacon/keepalive.json\n├── If fresh: do nothing\n├── If stale: poke Deacon (fallback)\n└── Process lifecycle requests (still daemon's job)\n\nDeacon (Claude agent, smart)\n├── Wakes: poke, timer, mail event\n├── Writes keepalive (quiets daemon for duration of rounds)\n├── Runs rounds molecule:\n│   ├── session-check: cycle if context budget low\n│   ├── health-scan: check agents, remediate\n│   ├── lifecycle: process requests\n│   ├── plugins: run scheduled/triggered plugins\n│   ├── events: process timer/event callbacks\n│   └── complete: update heartbeat, wait\n└── Reads marching orders from pinned bead\n```\n\n## Relation to Existing Work\n\n- Extends gt-5af (Deacon infrastructure) - CLOSED\n- Relates to gt-axz (Plugin architecture) - P3\n- Fits into phase3-deacon of gt-ngpz (Christmas Plan)\n- Enables gt-976 (Crew lifecycle) as part of health-scan step\n","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:46:08.076178-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.610323-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-id36","depends_on_id":"gt-976","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:48:05.215593-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.610323-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

Configuration (timeouts, thresholds, escalation rules)\n\n## Pinned Bead Structure\n\n```yaml\n# gt-deacon-kernel (pinned)\ntitle: \"Deacon Kernel Configuration\"\ntype: policy\npinned: true\n\nmolecule: mol-deacon-rounds\n  steps:\n    - session-check: \"Check context budget, cycle if needed\"\n    - health-scan: \"Check Mayor, Witnesses, Refineries, Crew\"\n    - lifecycle: \"Process pending lifecycle requests\"\n    - plugins: \"Run due scheduled plugins\"\n    - events: \"Process timer callbacks, event subscriptions\"\n    - complete: \"Update heartbeat, return to wait\"\n\nplugins:\n  scheduled:\n    - name: beads-hygiene\n      schedule: \"0 2 * * *\"  # 2 AM daily\n    - name: branch-cleanup\n      schedule: \"0 4 * * 0\"  # 4 AM Sundays\n  \n  event_triggers:\n    - event: \"issue.created\"\n      plugin: work-oracle\n    - event: \"mr.submitted\"\n      plugin: review-oracle\n\nconfig:\n  session_cycle_threshold_turns: 50\n  session_cycle_threshold_hours: 4\n  health_scan_timeout_seconds: 60\n  plugin_timeout_minutes: 30\n  escalation_after_failures: 3\n```\n\n## Reading Marching Orders\n\nOn wake, Deacon:\n1. `bd show --pinned` to find the kernel bead\n2. Parse molecule steps\n3. Execute in order\n\n## Updating the Kernel\n\nTo change Deacon behavior:\n1. `bd update gt-deacon-kernel` with new config\n2. Next wake cycle picks up changes\n3.

This can INTERRUPT the Deacon mid-work, especially during long\nplugin execution or health remediation.\n\n## Solution\n\nDeacon writes a keepalive file at start of rounds:\n```json\n{\n  \"timestamp\": \"2025-12-20T15:30:00Z\",\n  \"expected_duration_minutes\": 10,\n  \"action\": \"executing mol-deacon-rounds\"\n}\n```\n\nDaemon reads this and backs off:\n- If keepalive is fresh AND within expected_duration: skip poke\n- If keepalive is stale OR past expected_duration: poke (fallback)\n\n## Files\n\n- `{townRoot}/deacon/keepalive.json` - Written by Deacon\n- Daemon already reads `{townRoot}/deacon/heartbeat.json` - similar pattern\n\n## Deacon Behavior\n\n1. Start of rounds: write keepalive with expected duration\n2. End of rounds: write heartbeat (existing), clear/update keepalive\n3. If rounds take longer than expected: Deacon gets one poke, squelches it\n\n## Daemon Changes\n\nModify `pokeDeacon()` in daemon.go:\n1. Check keepalive.json freshness and expected_duration\n2. If within bounds: skip poke, log \"Deacon active\"\n3. If past bounds: poke as fallback\n\n## Worst Case\n\nDeacon crashes mid-rounds without clearing keepalive:\n- Daemon waits until expected_duration expires\n- Then pokes, triggering respawn loop\n- Max delay: expected_duration (configurable, default 10-15 min)\n\n## Configuration\n\nIn pinned kernel bead:\n```yaml\nconfig:\n  rounds_expected_duration_minutes: 10\n```\n","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:46:47.212234-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:56.70315-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-id36.3","depends_on_id":"gt-id36","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-20T21:46:47.213911-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:56.70315-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}

{"id":"gt-ingm","title":"Molecular Chemistry Cleanup: Fix inaccurate molecule depictions","description":"## The Correct Model\n\nAccording to molecular-chemistry.md, the hierarchy is:\n\nFormula (YAML DSL) --cook--\u003e Proto (template beads) --pour/wisp--\u003e Mol/Wisp (actual work)\n\n- **Formulas**: YAML files in .beads/formulas/ that define workflow structure\n- **Cook**: Transform formula to proto beads (with [template] label)\n- **Proto**: Template beads with child beads for each step\n- **Pour**: Proto to Mol (persistent liquid)\n- **Wisp**: Proto to Wisp (ephemeral vapor)\n\n## What's Wrong\n\nWe have legacy code and docs that use the OLD model where molecules are defined\nin Go code as structs with embedded markdown, instead of as formula YAML cooked into proto beads.\n\n---\n\n## MAJOR ISSUES\n\n### 1. Go Code: molecules_*.go (DELETE OR REWRITE)\n\n**Files:**\n- internal/beads/builtin_molecules.go\n- internal/beads/molecules_patrol.go (19KB!)\n- internal/beads/molecules_session.go (13KB)\n- internal/beads/molecules_work.go (13KB)\n\n**Problem:** Defines molecules as Go structs with embedded markdown descriptions.\nThis is completely wrong. Molecules should come from:\n1. Formula YAML files cooked into proto beads\n2. Proto beads with child beads for each step\n\n**Used by:**\n- install.go:seedBuiltinMolecules() - seeds during install\n- catalog.go - includes in catalog\n- molecule_list.go:ExportBuiltinMolecules()\n\n**Fix:** Delete these files. Create formula YAML files instead. Update seeding\nto cook formulas into protos.\n\n### 2. Role Templates: Steps Listed in Markdown (REWRITE)\n\n**Files:**\n- prompts/roles/deacon.md - Lists 7 patrol steps\n- prompts/roles/refinery.md - Lists 10 patrol steps\n- prompts/roles/witness.md - Procedural \"Heartbeat Protocol\" (not molecule-based!)\n- prompts/roles/polecat.md - References molecule steps\n\n**Problem:** The steps are listed in the markdown template, but they should be\ndiscovered from the proto beads via bd mol current. Templates should say\n\"check your hook, run your patrol\" without duplicating step definitions.\n\n**Fix:** Templates should describe HOW to run a patrol (propulsion principle,\nbd mol current, bd close --continue), not WHAT the steps are.\n\n### 3. Protos are Empty/Missing (CREATE)\n\n**Current state:**\n- gt-iep9 (mol-deacon-patrol) - Only 2 child steps\n- gt-qflq (mol-witness-patrol) - EMPTY (0 children)\n- mol-refinery-patrol - DOESN'T EXIST\n\n**Fix:** Create formula YAML files for each patrol, cook them into proper protos\nwith child beads for each step.\n\n---\n\n## MEDIUM ISSUES\n\n### 4. Command Confusion: spawn vs pour/wisp\n\n**Files:**\n- prompts/roles/deacon.md - Uses bd mol spawn ... --assignee=deacon\n- prompts/roles/refinery.md - Uses bd mol spawn ... --wisp\n- Various docs\n\n**Problem:** The correct commands per molecular-chemistry.md:\n- bd pour proto - Create persistent mol (liquid)\n- bd wisp proto - Create ephemeral wisp (vapor)\n- bd mol spawn - Old/deprecated\n\n**Fix:** Update all references to use bd wisp for patrols, bd pour for\npersistent work.\n\n### 5. Command Confusion: gt mol vs bd mol\n\n**Files:** Various docs and templates\n\n**Problem:** Some use gt mol status, others bd mol status. Need to clarify:\n- gt mol = Gas Town wrapper (if it exists, what does it add?)\n- bd mol = Beads molecule commands (authoritative)\n\n**Fix:** Audit and standardize. If gt mol is a thin wrapper, remove it.\n\n### 6. polecat-wisp-architecture.md (UPDATE OR DELETE)\n\n**File:** docs/polecat-wisp-architecture.md\n\n**Problem:** References adding molecules to builtin_molecules.go - old model.\n\n### 7. manager.go (UPDATE)\n\n**File:** internal/rig/manager.go\n\n**Problem:** Comment references \"subset of builtin_molecules.go for seeding\"\n\n---\n\n## IMPLEMENTATION ORDER\n\n1. **Create formula YAML files** for the 3 patrol molecules:\n   - mol-deacon-patrol.formula.yaml\n   - mol-witness-patrol.formula.yaml\n   - mol-refinery-patrol.formula.yaml\n\n2. **Implement bd cook** if not already working to create protos from formulas\n\n3. **Cook the formulas** into proto beads with proper child beads\n\n4. **Update role templates** to use propulsion principle without step lists\n\n5. **Delete molecules_*.go** once formulas are working\n\n6. **Update install.go** to cook formulas instead of seeding Go structs\n\n7. **Audit gt mol vs bd mol** and standardize","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-24T12:37:49.601971-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.713364-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-ingm","depends_on_id":"gt-6y8u","type":"relates-to","created_at":"2025-12-24T13:25:18.856554-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.713364-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

The prompt just sits there until manually nudged.\n\n## Evidence\n\n```\n$ gt spawn --issue gt-rixa --rig gastown --create\n...\n✓ Session started. Attach with: gt session at gastown/furiosa\n  Polecat nudged to start working\n  Witness notified to monitor startup\n```\n\nSession shows:\n```\n\u003e You have a work assignment. Run 'gt mail inbox' to see it, then start\n  working on issue gt-rixa.\n\n  ⏵⏵ bypass permissions on (shift+tab to cycle)\n```\n\nBut Claude doesn't respond. Manual nudge required:\n```\n$ gt nudge gt-gastown-furiosa \"Please start working...\"\n```\n\nAfter nudge, polecat immediately starts working correctly.\n\n## Hypothesis\n\nThe spawn inject happens before Claude Code is fully initialized. The text arrives in the input buffer, but Claude hasn't started listening yet. By the time Claude starts, the input has already been 'consumed' as initial prompt text but not submitted.\n\n## Resolution Plan\n\nThis will be solved by the **polecat molecule workflow** (mol-polecat-work), which provides structured lifecycle management. The molecule approach handles startup, work, and shutdown as discrete steps with proper state tracking.\n\n**Blocked on**: beads/crew/dave completing ephemeral molecules (bd mol bond, ephemeral beads repo).\n\n## Workaround\n\nFor now, use `gt nudge` if a polecat doesn't start within ~30 seconds of spawn.","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-21T14:06:27.375686-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.535065-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.535065-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"gt-jsup","title":"gt sling: patrol spawning must use wisp storage, not main DB","description":"**P0 Launch Blocker**\n\ngt sling to patrol roles (witness/refinery/deacon) currently spawns patrols into the main beads database instead of wisp storage. This will pollute the permanent database with ephemeral patrol cycles.\n\n**Root cause:**\nspawnMoleculeFromProto() with IsWisp=true uses `--db .beads-wisp/beads.db`, but the patrol TEMPLATE (e.g., gt-qp2w for mol-witness-patrol) only exists in the main database. So bd mol run fails with 'no issue found'.\n\n**The fix:**\nbd mol run needs to support reading the template from the main DB while writing the spawned instance to wisp storage. This is a cross-database spawn operation.\n\nOptions:\n1. Add `--template-db` flag to bd mol run (read template from here, write instance to --db)\n2. Copy template to wisp DB before spawning\n3. Make bd mol run automatically check main DB for templates when using wisp storage\n\n**Workaround applied (MUST REVERT):**\nSet IsWisp=false in slingToWitness/slingToRefinery/slingToDeacon patrol spawning.\n\n**Files:**\n- internal/cmd/sling.go: lines 680, 883, 1050 (IsWisp: false)\n- Needs fix in bd mol run (beads repo)","status":"tombstone","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-23T16:30:56.128658-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.469219-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.469219-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"gt-mbyy","title":"CLI API Audit: gt and bd command structure review before OSS launch","description":"# CLI API Audit for OSS Launch\n\nBefore launching Gas Town + Beads as an SDK, we need to ensure the command-line\nAPI is intelligently designed, consistent, intuitive, and structurally sound.\n\n## Current State Audit\n\n### gt (Gas Town) - 50+ top-level commands\n\n**Agent Lifecycle:**\n- `gt mayor`, `gt deacon`, `gt witness`, `gt refinery` - agent management\n- `gt polecat` - worker management (subcommands: add, remove, list, etc.)\n- `gt crew` - persistent workspace management\n- `gt spawn` - create polecat with work\n\n**Work Lifecycle:**\n- `gt spawn` - assign work to new polecat\n- `gt sling` - hook work + start immediately\n- `gt hook` - attach work durably\n- `gt handoff` - pass work to fresh session\n- `gt done` - signal work complete\n- `gt release` - release stuck issues\n\n**Infrastructure:**\n- `gt daemon`, `gt up`, `gt down`, `gt start`, `gt stop`, `gt shutdown`\n- `gt init`, `gt install`, `gt doctor`\n\n**Communication:**\n- `gt mail` (subcommands: send, inbox, read, etc.)\n- `gt nudge`, `gt broadcast`\n\n**Molecules:**\n- `gt molecule` / `gt mol` (17 subcommands!)\n\n### bd (Beads) - Well-categorized but some sprawl\n\n**Core CRUD:**\n- `bd create`, `bd show`, `bd update`, `bd close`, `bd list`\n\n**Molecules:**\n- `bd mol` (5 subcommands: catalog, show, bond, run, distill)\n- `bd wisp` (3 subcommands: create, gc, list)\n- `bd pour` (top-level alias for instantiation)\n- `bd cook` (compile formula to proto)\n\n**Hook/Pin:**\n- `bd pin` - attach mol to agent hook\n- `bd unpin` - remove from hook\n- `bd hook` - inspect what's on hook\n\n## Structural Concerns\n\n### 1. gt is sprawling (50+ top-level commands)\n\nMany commands could be subcommands:\n```\n# Current                      # Could be\ngt up/down/start/stop         gt daemon {up|down|start|stop}\ngt spawn/sling/hook/handoff   gt work {spawn|sling|hook|handoff}\ngt mayor/deacon/witness       gt agent {mayor|deacon|witness|...}\n```\n\n### 2. Overlap between gt and bd\n\n| Concept | gt | bd |\n|---------|----|----|\n| Hook | `gt hook` | `bd pin`, `bd hook` |\n| Mail | `gt mail` | `bd mail` (delegates) |\n| Molecules | `gt mol` (17 cmds) | `bd mol` (5 cmds) |\n\nWhich owns what? User confusion likely.\n\n### 3. Naming inconsistencies\n\n- `gt polecat` (noun) vs `gt spawn` (verb) - both about polecats\n- `gt done` vs `gt handoff` - both end work but different\n- `bd mol run` vs `bd pour` - both instantiate\n\n### 4. Subcommand depth decisions\n\n**Good patterns:**\n- `bd mol {catalog|show|bond|run|distill}` - coherent group\n- `gt mail {send|inbox|read|archive}` - coherent group\n\n**Questionable patterns:**\n- `bd create --wisp` AND `bd wisp create` - two ways to do same thing\n- `gt spawn --molecule X` AND `gt mol instantiate` - overlap\n\n### 5. Flag vs subcommand guidelines needed\n\nWhen to use flags vs subcommands?\n- `--json` as flag ✓ (modifier)\n- `--wisp` as flag for create? Or separate `bd wisp create`?\n- `--molecule` on spawn? Or separate workflow?\n\n## Recommendations to Evaluate\n\n### A. Consolidate gt top-level commands\n\nGroup related commands:\n```\ngt agent {mayor|deacon|witness|refinery|polecat}\ngt work {spawn|sling|hook|handoff|done}\ngt infra {daemon|up|down|doctor}\n```\n\n### B. Clarify gt vs bd ownership\n\n| Domain | Owner | Other defers |\n|--------|-------|--------------|\n| Issues | bd | gt uses bd |\n| Agents | gt | bd doesn't touch |\n| Molecules | bd mol | gt mol wraps for UX |\n| Hooks | bd pin/hook | gt hook wraps |\n| Mail | gt mail | bd mail delegates |\n\n### C. Apply consistent naming\n\n- All agent commands: nouns (`gt polecat`, `gt mayor`)\n- All work commands: verbs (`gt spawn`, `gt sling`, `gt hook`)\n- Avoid synonyms: pick one term and stick with it\n\n### D. Flag vs subcommand rule\n\n- Flags: modify behavior of command (`--json`, `--force`, `--wisp`)\n- Subcommands: distinct operations (`mol run`, `mol squash`, `mol burn`)\n- Exception: very common operations can have top-level aliases\n\n## Tasks\n\n1. [ ] Review gt command groupings - propose consolidation\n2. [ ] Review bd command groupings - check for sprawl\n3. [ ] Document gt vs bd ownership boundaries\n4. [ ] Identify and resolve naming inconsistencies\n5. [ ] Document flag vs subcommand decision criteria\n6. [ ] Create migration plan for any breaking changes\n7. [ ] Update help text to be consistent\n8. [ ] Test agent UX: can Claude guess commands correctly?\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- New user can guess command structure intuitively\n- `gt --help` fits on one screen (or is well-categorized)\n- No duplicate functionality between gt and bd\n- Consistent naming throughout\n- Claude agents can discover commands without documentation","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-24T23:48:42.420867-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.547876-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-mbyy","depends_on_id":"gt-jo9n","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-24T23:48:52.221824-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.547876-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

{"id":"gt-p3v5n","title":"Witness Arm Bonding","description":"# Witness Patrol Redesign\n\n\u003e **Status**: Design pivoted from Christmas Ornament to linear patrol (Dec 2024)\n\n## Original Problem\n\nWitness needs to monitor and intervene on multiple polecats. Original design proposed \"Christmas Ornament\" pattern with dynamic arms per polecat and fanout gates.\n\n## Design Pivot: Why Christmas Ornament Was Wrong\n\nThe Christmas Ornament pattern (dynamic mol-polecat-arm per worker) felt un-Gas-Town:\n\n1. **Explicit state tracking**: Nudge counts, timestamps, per-polecat state\n2. **Complex machinery**: Dynamic bonding, fanout gates, aggregation\n3. **Against philosophy**: Gas Town prefers discovery over tracking, events over state\n\n**Key insight**: With step-based polecat sessions (`gt mol step done` restarts session each step), polecats are either working a step or starting a step. \"Nudge counts across sessions\" becomes less meaningful.\n\n## New Design: Linear Patrol + Task Tool Parallelism + Cleanup Wisps\n\n### Patrol Shape (Deacon-style)\n\n```\ninbox-check -\u003e process-cleanups -\u003e check-refinery -\u003e survey-workers -\u003e context-check -\u003e loop\n```\n\nNo dynamic arms. No fanout gates. Linear and simple.\n\n### Key Changes\n\n| Aspect | Old (Christmas Ornament) | New (Linear Patrol) |\n|--------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| Per-polecat inspection | mol-polecat-arm bonded dynamically | Task tool subagents within survey-workers |\n| State tracking | Persistent nudge counts in handoff bead | Fresh observation each cycle (discover from beads timestamps) |\n| Cleanup queue | Explicit list in patrol state | Cleanup wisps (finalizer pattern) |\n| Parallelism | Molecule arms (fanout gate) | Task tool subagents |\n| Aggregation | waits_for: all-children | Task tool returns |\n\n### The Finalizer Pattern (Cleanup Wisps)\n\nWhen POLECAT_DONE arrives, Witness creates a cleanup wisp:\n```bash\nbd create --wisp --title \"cleanup:ace\" --labels cleanup,polecat:ace\n```\n\nThe wisp's existence IS the pending cleanup. Witness processes these in `process-cleanups` step:\n- Verify git clean, issue closed, commits exist\n- Kill session, remove worktree\n- Burn the wisp\n\nFailed cleanups? Leave wisp, retry next cycle. GC-style finalization.\n\n### Task Tool Parallelism\n\nInstead of molecule arms, use Claude's Task tool for parallel polecat inspection:\n\n```markdown\n## survey-workers step\n\nFor each polecat, launch a Task tool subagent:\n- Capture tmux state\n- Assess working/idle/error/done\n- Check beads for step progress\n- Decide and execute action (nudge/escalate/none)\n\nTask tool handles parallelism. No molecule machinery needed.\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\n- [x] Draft mol-witness-patrol-v2.formula.toml (linear patrol)\n- [ ] Test new patrol formula\n- [ ] Deprecate mol-polecat-arm\n- [ ] Remove fanout gate dependency\n\n## Files\n\n- `.beads/formulas/mol-witness-patrol-v2.formula.toml` - New linear patrol\n- `.beads/formulas/mol-witness-patrol.formula.toml` - Old Christmas Ornament (to deprecate)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Witness patrols work with 3+ polecats using Task tool parallelism\n- Cleanup wisps correctly track pending cleanups\n- No persistent nudge state - fresh observation each cycle\n- Simpler, more Gas Town-y design","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:46:22.29819-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.489656-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-p3v5n","depends_on_id":"gt-psj76","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:47:17.026491-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"gt-p3v5n","depends_on_id":"gt-twjr5","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-25T20:55:05.133165-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:52.489656-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

No Refinery automation. Just the core propulsion loop.\n\n## Key Insight: Molecules Are the Logic\n\nGo code is connector/glue. The cognition lives in molecules. When the Deacon\nwakes up, it reads its hook, finds a molecule, and WALKS IT. The molecule\nsays what to do. Go just provides the verbs (spawn, send, close).\n\n## The Propulsion Principle\n\n\u003e If you find something on your hook, YOU RUN IT.\n\nThis is the universal Gas Town rule.

{"id":"gt-ronyn","title":"CRITICAL: gt doctor orphan-processes kills active crew sessions","description":"## Problem\n\nThe deacon's patrol runs `gt doctor --fix` which includes an orphan-processes check. This check is incorrectly identifying ACTIVE crew sessions as orphaned and killing them.\n\n## Impact\n\n- Crew workers are being killed mid-session\n- Work is lost\n- The deacon is currently disabled until this is fixed\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe orphan-processes detection logic in `internal/doctor/` doesn't properly identify crew workers. It likely:\n1. Doesn't recognize the `gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e` session pattern for crew\n2. Or misidentifies the Claude process as orphaned when it has a valid tmux parent\n\n## Workaround\n\nThe patrol formula was updated to instruct deacon not to run `--fix` if orphan-processes reports any PIDs. But this workaround failed - the deacon still killed crew.\n\n## Fix Required\n\n1. Update `internal/doctor/identity_check.go` or `branch_check.go` to properly detect crew sessions\n2. Add crew session patterns to the valid session detection\n3. Add test coverage for crew worker scenarios\n\n## Files\n\n- internal/doctor/identity_check.go\n- internal/doctor/branch_check.go  \n- internal/cmd/doctor.go\n\n## Related\n\n- Commit 3452b041 attempted to fix via formula instructions but failed\n- The digest hq-yedg claimed to file gt-vj5zc but never did","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-27T00:14:05.870126-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.789954-08:00","created_by":"deacon","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:45.789954-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"bug"}

{"id":"gt-sult","title":"gt spawn beads sync warning is misleading for redirect-based polecats","description":"## Problem\n\nWhen spawning a polecat, gt spawn shows a warning:\n```\nWarning: beads sync: exit status 1\n```\n\nThis is misleading because polecats using the redirect architecture (`.beads/redirect`) share the canonical database at `mayor/rig/.beads/beads.db`. The 'stale beads' indicated by the warning is just git branch divergence (main vs beads-sync), not actual data staleness.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\ngt spawn should either:\n1. Skip the beads sync check for polecats using redirects (they share the canonical DB)\n2. Or provide a clearer message like 'beads redirect active, using shared database'\n\n## Reproduction\n\n```bash\ngt spawn --issue gt-xxx --rig gastown --create\n# Shows 'Warning: beads sync: exit status 1' even though beads are current\n```\n\n## Root Cause\n\nspawn.go calls beads sync and treats any non-zero exit as a warning. But with redirects, the polecat doesn't need its own beads - it uses the canonical source via the redirect chain:\n```\npolecat/.beads/redirect -\u003e ../../.beads -\u003e gastown/.beads/redirect -\u003e mayor/rig/.beads\n```\n\n## Fix Options\n\n1.

{"id":"gt-tnca","title":"Design mol-ready-work patrol for crew workers","description":"## Summary\n\nDesign and implement a protomolecule (mol-ready-work) that enables crew workers to autonomously work through backlogs when the overseer is away. This replaces the normal \"await instructions\" patrol step with productive backlog processing.\n\n## Context\n\nCrew workers like dave/joe are persistent, user-managed agents. Currently their patrol loop has an \"await instructions\" step that idles. We want an alternative: sling mol-ready-work at them and they crank through backlogs until:\n- The overseer interrupts with new instructions\n- Context fills up (request handoff)\n- Backlogs are empty\n\n## Backlogs (Priority Order)\n\n1. **Open PRs** - Review/merge pending pull requests\n2. **Untriaged GH issues** - New issues needing triage\n3. **Open beads work** - bd ready items (unblocked issues)\n4. **Triaged GH issues** - Bugs/features to implement\n\n## Key Features\n\n### ROI-Based Selection\nInstead of strict priority, agent applies ROI heuristic:\n- Size estimate (fits in remaining context?)\n- Achievability (has all needed info?)\n- Impact (priority + type weight)\n- Pick highest-value achievable item\n\n### Context Management\n- Check token usage after each work item\n- Request handoff before running out\n- Leave clear handoff notes (mail to self)\n- Next session picks up the patrol\n\n### Patrol Loop Structure\n```\norient → scan-backlogs → select-work → execute-work → check-context → (loop or handoff)\n```\n\n## Design Questions\n\n1. How does gt sling work? Does it exist?\n2. How does this interact with the normal crew patrol?\n3. Should the molecule go in Gas Town catalog or per-rig?\n4. How does bonding work for discovered work during execution?\n5. Should this be a wisp (ephemeral) or mol (persistent)?\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] mol-ready-work protomolecule defined in catalog\n- [ ] gt sling command implemented (or existing mechanism documented)\n- [ ] Context-checking step works with agent token awareness\n- [ ] Handoff mechanism integrates with gt mail\n- [ ] Documentation for crew workers on using the patrol","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-22T23:45:40.63509-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:56.309081-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:56.309081-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

Agent Crash Mid-Operation\n\n**Scenario**: Polecat crashes while committing, Witness crashes while verifying\n\n**Detection**:\n- Session suddenly gone (tmux check fails)\n- State shows 'working' but no session\n- Heartbeat stops (for Witness)\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Doctor detects via ZombieSessionCheck\n- Capture any recoverable state\n- Reset agent state to 'idle'\n- For Witness: auto-restart via supervisor or manual gt witness start\n\n### 2. Git State Corruption\n\n**Scenario**: Merge conflict, failed rebase, detached HEAD\n\n**Detection**:\n- Git commands fail\n- Dirty state that won't commit\n- Branch diverged from origin\n\n**Recovery**:\n- gt doctor reports git health issues\n- Manual intervention recommended\n- Severe cases: remove clone, re-clone\n\n### 3. Beads Sync Conflict\n\n**Scenario**: Two polecats modify same issue\n\n**Detection**:\n- bd sync fails with conflict\n- Beads tombstone mechanism handles most cases\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Beads has last-write-wins semantics\n- bd sync --force in extreme cases\n- Issues may need manual dedup\n\n### 4. Tmux Failure\n\n**Scenario**: Tmux server crashes, socket issues\n\n**Detection**:\n- All sessions inaccessible\n- \"no server running\" errors\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Kill any orphan processes\n- tmux kill-server \u0026\u0026 tmux start-server\n- All agent states reset to idle\n- Re-spawn active work\n\n### 5. Claude API Issues\n\n**Scenario**: Rate limits, outages, context limits\n\n**Detection**:\n- Sessions hang or produce errors\n- Repeated failure patterns\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Exponential backoff (handled by Claude Code)\n- For context limits: session cycling (mail-to-self)\n- For outages: wait and retry\n\n### 6. Disk Full\n\n**Scenario**: Clones, logs, or beads fill disk\n\n**Detection**:\n- Write operations fail\n- git/bd commands error\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Clean up logs: rm ~/.gastown/logs/*\n- Remove old polecat clones\n- gt doctor --fix can clean some cruft\n\n### 7. Network Failure\n\n**Scenario**: Can't reach GitHub, API servers\n\n**Detection**:\n- git fetch/push fails\n- Claude sessions hang\n\n**Recovery**:\n- Work continues locally\n- Queue pushes for later\n- Sync when connectivity restored\n\n## Recovery Principles\n\n1. **Fail safe**: Prefer stopping over corrupting\n2. **State is recoverable**: Git and beads have recovery mechanisms\n3. **Doctor heals**: gt doctor --fix handles common issues\n4. **Emergency stop**: gt stop --all as last resort\n5. **Human escalation**: Some failures need Overseer intervention\n\n## Implementation\n\n- Document each failure mode in architecture.md\n- Ensure doctor checks cover detection\n- Add recovery hints to error messages\n- Log all failures for debugging","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-15T23:19:07.198289-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:54.504304-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:54.504304-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}

This wastes resources and creates\nunnecessary log noise.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. **Gradual slowdown**: Deacon patrol frequency should exponentially back off\n   when there's no activity in the town.\n\n2. **Wake on activity**: Any gt or bd command (human or agent) should reset\n   the backoff immediately.\n\n3. **Daemon coordination**: Deacon needs to \"program\" the daemon for next\n   heartbeat duration.\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n### Option A: Daemon tracks last-activity timestamp\n- Daemon mechanically slows heartbeat based on time since last activity\n- Activity signal comes from gt/bd command hooks\n- Simple, no Deacon state needed\n- But: Daemon is \"dumb\" by design - adding intelligence here feels wrong\n\n### Option B: Deacon tracks patrol-count-since-activity\n- Deacon maintains counter (via label on patrol molecule or state.json)\n- Each idle patrol increments counter, calculates next sleep\n- Deacon tells daemon \"wake me in X minutes\"\n- More complex but keeps intelligence in AI agent\n\n### Option C: Discovery-based (preferred if feasible)\n- Can we detect \"no activity\" without explicit counters?\n- Ideas:\n  - Compare current time to last git commit across all clones?\n  - Check tmux activity timestamps?\n  - Look at beads modification times?\n- Pros: No state to manage\n- Cons: May be expensive to compute, could miss activity\n\n### Wake mechanism\n- Hook on gt commands (gt.hooks.pre-command or similar)\n- Hook on bd commands (bd.hooks.pre-command)\n- Both should signal daemon (SIGUSR2?) or write to activity file\n- Daemon reads activity file on each heartbeat, resets backoff if fresh\n\n### Backoff schedule (strawman)\n| Idle patrols | Next heartbeat |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| 0-5          | 5 min (default) |\n| 6-10         | 10 min |\n| 11-20        | 30 min |\n| 21+          | 60 min (max) |\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Should tmux activity count as \"activity\"? (cursor movement, typing)\n2. How does Deacon communicate next-heartbeat to daemon?\n3. Where to store backoff state? (daemon state.json? deacon state.json? label?)\n4. Should wake be instant (SIGUSR) or next-heartbeat?\n\n## Implementation Sketch\n\nActivity file written by hooks at ~/gt/daemon/activity.json:\n- last_command: timestamp\n- command: the gt/bd command that ran\n- actor: who ran it","status":"tombstone","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-26T19:09:17.544704-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:54.766314-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:54.766314-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"epic"}

This is critical for the beads propulsion cycle - turning agent sessions from pets into cattle.\n\n## Current State (Inconsistent)\n\n| Role | Current Guidance | Command |\n|------|-----------------|---------|\n| Mayor | Manual mail send | `gt mail send mayor/ -s 'HANDOFF:...' -m '...'` |\n| Crew | Manual mail send | `gt mail send \u003crig\u003e/crew/\u003cname\u003e -s 'HANDOFF:...' -m '...'` |\n| Witness | Manual mail send | `gt mail send \u003crig\u003e/witness -s 'HANDOFF:...' -m '...'` |\n| Refinery | Manual mail send | `gt mail send \u003crig\u003e/refinery -s 'HANDOFF:...' -m '...'` |\n| Deacon | Exit on high context | (implicit) |\n| Polecat | `gt done` | `gt done [--exit TYPE]` |\n\n## Target State (Unified)\n\nAll roles use `gt handoff`:\n- `gt handoff` - Hand off current session to fresh instance\n- `gt handoff -s 'context' -m 'details'` - Hand off with custom message\n- For polecats: `gt handoff` internally calls `gt done`\n\n## Changes Required\n\n### 1. Code Changes\n- [ ] Update `gt handoff` to detect polecat role and call `gt done` internally\n- [ ] Consider adding `--exit` flag to `gt handoff` for polecat compatibility\n\n### 2. CLAUDE.md Updates (gastown)\n- [ ] ~/gt/CLAUDE.md (Mayor)\n- [ ] gastown/crew/max/CLAUDE.md\n- [ ] gastown/crew/joe/CLAUDE.md\n- [ ] gastown/witness/CLAUDE.md\n- [ ] gastown/refinery/CLAUDE.md (and rig/)\n- [ ] deacon/CLAUDE.md\n\n### 3.

At any time, any agent can:\n1. Send itself a detailed handoff mail (or sling itself a mol)\n2. System shuts them down and restarts them\n3. Fresh session runs priming and reads mail\n4. Work continues seamlessly\n\nThis enables:\n- Unlimited context through automatic cycling\n- Clean recovery from any state\n- Consistent behavior across all roles\n- Simplified agent instructions","status":"tombstone","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-23T12:57:25.246279-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.032182-08:00","deleted_at":"2025-12-27T21:29:53.032182-08:00","deleted_by":"daemon","delete_reason":"delete","original_type":"task"}
