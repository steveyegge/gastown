Popup?\n3. **Cross-rig aggregation**: Merge events from multiple rig daemons?\n4. **Filtering UX**: By rig, by molecule, by event type?\n\n## Implementation Options\n\n**Phase 1: Simple wrapper**\n- `gt feed` shells out to `bd activity --follow`\n- Add `--rig` flag for filtering\n- Works identically with/without tmux\n\n**Phase 2: Tmux-aware**\n- Detect if running in gt tmux session\n- Offer to open in dedicated pane\n- `gt feed --pane` to force pane mode\n\n**Phase 3: Cross-rig** (if needed)\n- Aggregate from multiple rig daemons\n- Unified activity stream across town\n\n## Related\n\n- gt-rivr (tombstoned) - Original TUI epic\n- gt-22ng - Activity aggregator (blocked)\n- bd activity command - The underlying implementation\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-28T09:34:48.026886-08:00","created_by":"gastown/crew/joe","updated_at":"2025-12-28T09:59:40.364918-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-28T09:59:40.364918-08:00"}

{"id":"gt-552hb","title":"Epic: Fix swarm orchestration - witness/refinery/polecat lifecycle","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nThe bd-9115 swarm execution required excessive manual intervention from Mayor. The witness, refinery, and polecat lifecycle components didn't coordinate automatically.\n\n## What Should Have Happened\n\n```\nMayor slings 6 beads to rig\n    ↓\nPolecats auto-spawn with synced beads, work pinned\n    ↓\nPolecats work autonomously\n    ↓\nWitness monitors progress, nudges stuck polecats\n    ↓\nPolecat completes → pushes branch → signals completion\n    ↓\nRefinery detects ready branch → rebases → merges → deletes branch\n    ↓\nWitness detects merge → nukes polecat worktree\n    ↓\nWhen all done → Witness notifies Mayor\n```\n\n## What Actually Happened\n\n1. **gt sling failed to pin beads** - polecat worktrees had stale JSONL\n2. **Manual intervention** - had to checkout latest JSONL, pin, nudge each polecat\n3. **Witness was passive** - never nudged or checked on polecats\n4. **Refinery waited for requests** - didn't detect completed branches\n5. **Manual lifecycle** - Mayor had to close beads, nuke polecats\n6. **Manual merge coordination** - had to mail refinery with merge order\n\n## Root Cause: Branch Hysteresis\n\nPolecat branches persist across runs and drift from main/beads-sync:\n- `polecat/foo` created weeks ago from old main\n- New work slung to `polecat/foo` \n- JSONL in branch doesn't have new beads\n- Pin fails\n\n## Open Questions\n\n### Q1: Fresh branches per run?\nShould each polecat spawn create a NEW branch from latest main/beads-sync?\n```\ngt sling bd-xxx rig\n  → creates polecat/foo-20251227-1630 from origin/main\n  → ensures JSONL is current\n  → after merge, branch deleted forever\n```\nPros: No drift, always current\nCons: Branch proliferation, naming complexity\n\n### Q2: Rebase existing branches?\nOr should we rebase persistent polecat branches before work?\n```\ngt sling bd-xxx rig/foo\n  → git fetch origin\n  → git rebase origin/main\n  → now JSONL is current\n```\nPros: Keeps simple naming\nCons: Rebase can fail with conflicts\n\n### Q3: Just cherry-pick JSONL?\nMinimal fix - grab latest JSONL before pinning:\n```\ngit checkout origin/beads-sync -- .beads/issues.jsonl\nbd import  # refresh DB\nbd pin bd-xxx\n```\nPros: Simple, surgical\nCons: Doesn't fix code drift, just beads\n\n### Q4: Shared beads DB?\nCould polecats share a DB (via symlink or sqlite over network)?\nPros: Always consistent\nCons: Locking complexity, daemon conflicts\n\n### Q5: Who owns polecat lifecycle?\n- Witness? (current assumption)\n- Refinery? (after merge)\n- gt sling? (on spawn)\n- New \"foreman\" role?\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\nSee child issues for implementation details. Need to resolve open questions first.\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:40:10.727376-08:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2025-12-28T16:12:13.598411-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-28T16:12:13.598411-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-552hb","depends_on_id":"gt-ake0m","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:41:15.984785-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"gt-552hb","depends_on_id":"gt-dtw9u","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:41:16.036312-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"gt-552hb","depends_on_id":"gt-qpwv4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:41:16.08566-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"gt-552hb","depends_on_id":"gt-6qyt1","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:41:16.134048-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"gt-552hb","depends_on_id":"gt-budeb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:41:16.182989-08:00","created_by":"daemon"},{"issue_id":"gt-552hb","depends_on_id":"gt-5j3ia","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-27T16:41:16.231484-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Track file change frequency per MR (sliding window, e.g., last 24h)\n2. At spawn time, analyze issue description / planned changes\n3. If touching hot files, either:\n   - Warn and proceed\n   - Suggest waiting for queue to clear\n   - Auto-assign to ownership zone (future)\n\n## Implementation\n- Add file_changes log to refinery state (or separate hotspot.json)\n- After each merge, record changed files with timestamp\n- gt spawn checks hotspots before assignment\n- Optional: Witness patrol aggregates hotspot data\n\n## Example\n```\n$ gt spawn --issue gt-xyz\nWarning: This issue likely touches auth/login.go\n  - Changed 3 times in last 2 hours\n  - 2 MRs pending that also touch this file\nProceed anyway?

Log the intervention\ngt mail send \u003cagent\u003e -s 'FORCE_KILL: unresponsive' -m 'Deacon detected...'\n\n# 2. Kill the tmux session\ntmux kill-session -t \u003csession-name\u003e\n\n# 3.

Notify mayor (optional, for visibility)\ngt mail send mayor/ -s 'Agent killed: \u003cagent\u003e' -m 'Reason: unresponsive...'\n```\n\n## Recovery\n\nAfter force-kill, the agent is 'asleep'. Normal wake mechanisms apply:\n- `gt rig boot` restarts it\n- Or stays asleep until next activity trigger\n\n## Parameters (configurable)\n\n- ping_timeout: 30s (how long to wait for response)\n- consecutive_failures: 3 (how many before force-kill)\n- cooldown: 5m (minimum time between force-kills of same agent)\n\n## NOT Deacon's Job\n\n- Graceful shutdown (agent does this itself)\n- Context-based recycling (agent self-handoffs)\n- Normal backoff/sleep transitions\n\nDeacon only force-kills when agent is genuinely unresponsive.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"gastown/polecats/slit","created_at":"2025-12-28T23:09:21.694807-08:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2025-12-30T22:11:13.044466-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-30T22:11:13.044466-08:00","close_reason":"Implemented stuck-session detection and force-kill protocol with new commands: health-check, force-kill, health-state","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-l6ro3.4","depends_on_id":"gt-l6ro3","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-12-28T23:09:21.695345-08:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

You process\ncompleted polecat work, merging it to main one branch at a time with\nsequential rebasing.\n\nYour mission: Process the merge queue sequentially, rebasing each branch\natop the current baseline before merging.\n\nsession_pattern: gt-{rig}-refinery\nwork_dir_pattern: {town}/{rig}/refinery/rig\nneeds_pre_sync: true\nstart_command: exec claude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n\ndefault_molecule: mol-refinery-patrol\ncapabilities:\n  - merge_queue_processing\n  - sequential_rebase\n  - conflict_resolution\n  - verification_gates\n\n## The Engineer Mindset\n\nYou are Scotty in the engine room. The merge queue is your warp core.\n\nThe Beads Promise: Work is never lost. If you discover ANY problem:\n1. Fix it now (preferred if quick), OR\n2. File a bead and proceed (tracked for cleanup crew)\n\nThere is NO third option. Never \"disavow\" by noting something exists and moving on.\n\nThe Scotty Test: Before proceeding past any failure, ask yourself:\n\"Would Scotty walk past a warp core leak because it existed before his shift?\"\n\n## Propulsion Principle\n\nIf you find something on your hook, YOU RUN IT.\n\nYour work is defined by the mol-refinery-patrol molecule. Execute steps:\n- bd ready (find next step)\n- bd show \u003cstep-id\u003e (see what to do)\n- bd close \u003cstep-id\u003e (mark complete)\n\n## Sequential Rebase Protocol\n\nWRONG (parallel merge - causes conflicts):\n  main then branch-A (old main) + branch-B (old main) = CONFLICTS\n\nRIGHT (sequential rebase):\n  main then merge A (rebased on main) then merge B (rebased on main+A)\n\nAfter every merge, main moves. Next branch MUST rebase on new baseline.\n\n## Verification Gate\n\nThe handle-failures step is a verification gate:\n- Tests PASSED: Gate satisfied, proceed to merge\n- Tests FAILED (branch caused): Abort, notify polecat, skip branch\n- Tests FAILED (pre-existing): MUST fix OR file bead - cannot proceed without\n\n## Commands\n\n### Patrol\n- gt mol status - Check attached patrol\n- bd ready / bd show / bd close - Step management\n- bd mol spawn \u003cmol\u003e --wisp - Spawn patrol wisp\n\n### Git Operations\n- git fetch origin - Fetch all remote branches\n- git branch -r | grep polecat - List polecat branches\n- git rebase origin/main - Rebase on current main\n- git push origin main - Push merged changes\n\n### Communication\n- gt mail inbox - Check for messages\n- gt mail send \u003caddr\u003e -s \"Subject\" -m \"Message\" - Notify workers","status":"hooked","priority":2,"issue_type":"role","assignee":"gastown/polecats/rictus","created_at":"2025-12-28T00:51:21.133839-08:00","created_by":"stevey","updated_at":"2025-12-30T02:03:13.028107-08:00"}

{"id":"gt-t6muy","title":"Design: Polecat lifecycle and patrol coordination","description":"## Context\n\nThis design captures thinking from a deep session about the Gas Town propulsion system - how Deacon, Witness, Refinery, and Polecats coordinate to move work smoothly through the system.\n\n## Core Insight: Session-Per-Step Model\n\nPolecats do NOT complete complex molecules end-to-end. Instead:\n- One polecat SESSION per molecule STEP\n- Same sandbox (branch/worktree) persists across sessions\n- Each step: spawn → work → close bead → recycle session\n- Final step: spawn → work → close bead → signal complete → merge → nuke sandbox\n\n## Two Cleanup Stages\n\n| Stage | Trigger | Kills | Survives |\n|-------|---------|-------|----------|\n| Step cleanup | Step bead closed | Session | Branch, worktree, molecule |\n| Molecule cleanup | Merged | Session, branch, worktree | Digest |\n\n## Per-Rig Polecat Channel\n\nNeed a mailing list/queue per rig for session-lifecycle requests:\n- \"Recycle me\" (from polecat)\n- \"Recycle worker X\" (from witness/mayor)\n- \"Spawn for step Y\" (from anyone)\n\nFirst-come-first-served by patrolling agents. Anyone on patrol (Witness, Refinery, Crew, Mayor) can service requests.\n\n## GUPP + Pinned Work = Completion\n\nAs long as:\n1. Work is pinned to polecat identity (e.g., gastown/furiosa)\n2. Sandbox persists (branch + worktree)\n3. Someone keeps spawning polecat when it dies\n\n→ The molecule WILL get finished. GUPP ensures wake-and-work.\n\n## Daemon → Deacon Heartbeat\n\nThe daemon pings the deacon, keeping the cycle alive. Deacon peeks into rig-wide channels during patrol and can service lifecycle requests.\n\n## Open Design Questions\n\n### Q1: Spoon-Feeding Bin-Packing\nTwo dimensions of granularity trade-offs:\n- How many logical steps per physical molecule step?\n- How many molecule steps per polecat session?\n\nToo few steps → context exhaustion, forgetting\nToo many steps → overhead, fragmentation\n\nNeeds: Analysis of optimal granularity based on step complexity.\n\n### Q2: Mechanical vs Agent-Driven Recycling\nCaution from deacon murder spree bug: mechanical detection of \"stuck\" workers is fragile.\n\nPrefer: Explicit \"recycle me\" requests serviced by patrol agents.\n\nQuestion: When is mechanical intervention appropriate?\n\n### Q3: Channel Implementation\nOptions:\n- Mail-based (gt mail to rig/polecats)\n- Beads-based (special issue type)\n- State file (rig/polecat-queue.json)\n\nMail seems most consistent with Gas Town patterns.\n\n### Q4: Who Spawns Next Step?\nCurrent: gt sling spawns fresh polecat\nNeeded: Mechanism for \"continue molecule on existing sandbox\"\n\nMaybe: gt sling --continue or witness detects pending step.\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- gt-dtw9u: Witness monitoring (enhance survey-workers)\n- gt-qpwv4: Completion detection (check ready branches)\n- gt-6qyt1: Refinery queue (process MERGE_READY)\n- gt-budeb: Auto-nuke (handle MERGED signal)\n- gt-5j3ia: Swarm aggregation (batch completion)\n- gt-1dbcp: Polecat auto-start (SessionStart hook issue)\n\n## Design Principles (from HOP/MEOW context)\n\n1. **Discovery over tracking** - observe reality each cycle\n2. **Mail as coordination primitive** - agents signal via mail\n3. **ZFC** - Claude makes judgment calls, no hardcoded thresholds\n4. **Redundant monitoring** - overlapping observation is resilience\n5. **Wisps are ephemeral** - patrol molecules flow like water\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.

{"id":"gt-ubqeg","title":"Formula Molecules: Guzzoline production for Gas Town","description":"## Vision\n\nGas Town executes work. But it also needs to PRODUCE work - structured, high-quality guzzoline on demand. **Formula Molecules** are recipes that spawn structured convoys.\n\n## Core Insight\n\nA formula is a molecule template that:\n1. Takes input (a PR, a design problem, a codebase)\n2. Spawns multiple polecats with specific focuses\n3. Each leg produces structured output\n4. Synthesis step combines into unified deliverable\n\nGas Town becomes both consumer AND producer of guzzoline.\n\n## Example Formulas\n\n### Design Convoy Formula\nInput: Feature request or problem statement\nLegs (parallel):\n- API design polecat\n- Data model polecat  \n- UX/ergonomics polecat\n- Scalability polecat\n- Security polecat\nSynthesis: Unified design doc with tradeoffs\n\n### Code Review Convoy Formula\nInput: PR or file set\nLegs (parallel):\n- Correctness: Does it work?\n- Performance: Any bottlenecks?\n- Security: Vulnerabilities?\n- Elegance: Clean design?\n- Resilience: Error handling?\n- Style: Convention compliance?\n- Smells: Anti-patterns?\n- Legacy: Respects existing patterns?\nSynthesis: Categorized review with priority issues\n\n### Other Formula Ideas\n- Test Coverage Convoy: Unit, integration, edge cases, error paths\n- Documentation Convoy: API docs, user guide, examples, changelog\n- Migration Convoy: Database, API, config, rollback plan\n- Incident Response: Root cause, timeline, fix, prevention\n\n## Mol Mall\n\nLibrary/marketplace of formulas:\n```bash\ngt formula list              # Available formulas\ngt formula show code-review  # Formula details\ngt formula run code-review --pr=123  # Execute formula → convoy\ngt formula create my-review  # Create custom formula\n```\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Formula Structure (in beads)\n```yaml\nid: formula-code-review\ntype: formula\nname: Code Review\ninputs:\n  - name: target\n    type: pr | files | branch\nlegs:\n  - name: correctness\n    focus: \"Verify logical correctness and edge cases\"\n    output: findings.md\n  - name: security\n    focus: \"Identify security vulnerabilities\"\n    output: findings.md\n  # ...\nsynthesis:\n  inputs: all leg outputs\n  output: review-summary.md\n```\n\n### Execution Model\n1. `gt formula run` creates convoy with formula reference\n2. Spawns polecats for each leg (parallel where possible)\n3. Each polecat gets leg-specific prompt + shared context\n4. Outputs collected as bead attachments or slots\n5. Synthesis polecat reads all outputs, produces final deliverable\n6. Convoy lands with unified result\n\n### Dependencies\n- Leg outputs feed synthesis (internal convoy deps)\n- Formula can specify leg ordering if needed\n- Parallel by default, sequential where required\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Where do formulas live? Town-level beads? Separate formula registry?\n2. How to version/share formulas across towns?\n3. Leg output format standardization?\n4. Human checkpoints between legs or only at end?\n5. Partial formula runs (skip some legs)?\n6. Formula composition (formula that includes other formulas)?\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nGas Town currently waits for humans to create work. With formulas:\n- Mayor can invoke structured reviews on any PR\n- Design work follows consistent methodology\n- Quality processes are repeatable and scalable\n- Work generation becomes as automated as work execution\n\n**Guzzoline factory, not just guzzoline consumer.**","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-31T13:19:45.702191-08:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2025-12-31T13:19:45.702191-08:00"}

Every meaningful action creates a beads mutation; agents subscribe to\nthe feed and wake within ~500ms. The timeout is just a safety net.\n\n**OLD**: Time-driven. Wake because time passed.

No wake_on conditions - signals carry no semantic meaning. Just wake up.\n   Agent discovers reality by checking mail, beads, hook, git state.\n\n2. Read-only commands do not wake - gt status, bd show create no mutations.\n\n3. Daemon is recovery-focused - catches edge cases (GUPP violations, dead sessions).\n\n4.

Mayor is never involved in\nroutine worker management.\n\n## Propulsion Principle\n\nIf you find something on your hook, YOU RUN IT.\n\nYour work is defined by the mol-witness-patrol molecule. Execute steps:\n- bd ready (find next step)\n- bd show \u003cstep-id\u003e (see what to do)\n- bd close \u003cstep-id\u003e (mark complete)\n\n## Nudge Protocol\n\nProgress through stages. Track nudge count per worker per issue.\n- First Nudge (10+ min idle): Gentle inquiry\n- Second Nudge (15 min): Direct question\n- Third Nudge (20 min): Final warning\nAfter 3 nudges with no progress then escalate to Mayor\n\n## Pre-Kill Verification\n\nBefore killing ANY polecat session:\n1. gt polecat git-state \u003cname\u003e - Must be clean\n2. Check for uncommitted work\n3. Check for unpushed commits\n4. Verify issue closed\n5. Verify PR submitted (if applicable)\n\n## Commands\n\n- gt polecat list \u003crig\u003e - See all polecats\n- gt polecat git-state \u003cname\u003e - Check git cleanliness\n- tmux capture-pane -t gt-\u003crig\u003e-\u003cname\u003e -p | tail -40 - Session inspection\n- gt mail inbox - Check messages\n- gt mail send mayor/ -s \"Subject\" -m \"Message\" - Escalate","status":"hooked","priority":2,"issue_type":"role","assignee":"gastown/polecats/slit","created_at":"2025-12-28T00:51:20.912437-08:00","created_by":"stevey","updated_at":"2025-12-30T02:02:49.746012-08:00"}
